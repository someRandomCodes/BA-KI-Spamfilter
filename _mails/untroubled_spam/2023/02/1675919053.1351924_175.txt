Bach composed his cantata in 1723 for the Sunday Estomihi (Quinquagesima), the last Sunday before Lent. In Leipzig, tempus clausum was observed during Lent, therefore it was the last Sunday with a cantata performance before a celebration of the Annunciation, Palm Sunday and the vespers service on Good Friday and Easter.[27] The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, "praise of love" (1 Corinthians 13:1–13), and from the Gospel of Luke, healing the blind near Jericho (Luke 18:31–43). The Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in Jerusalem, and that the disciples do not understand what he is saying. The cantata text is the usual combination of Bible quotation, free contemporary poetry and as closing chorale a stanza from a hymn as an affirmation. An unknown poet chose from the Gospel verses 31 and 34 as the text for movement 1, and wrote a sequence of aria, recitative and aria for the following movements. His poetic text places the Christian in general, including the listener at Bach's time or any time, in the situation of the disciples: he is pictured as wanting to follow Jesus even in suffering, although he does not comprehend.[16] The poetry ends on a prayer for "denial of the flesh". The closing chorale is stanza 5 of Elisabeth Cruciger's "Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn",[28] intensifying the prayer,[29] on a melody from the Lochamer-Liederbuch.[30] Stylistic comparisons with other works by Bach suggest that the same poet wrote the texts for both audition cantatas and also for the two first cantatas which Bach performed when taking up his office.[31] The poetry for the second aria has an unusually long first section, which Bach handled elegantly by repeating only part of it in the da capo.[32] Structure and scoring Bach structured the cantata in five movements, and scored it for three vocal soloists (an alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir (SATB), and for a Baroque orchestra of an oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viol

23 for the Sunday Estomihi (Quinquagesima), the last Sunday before Lent. In=
 Leipzig, tempus clausum was observed during Lent, therefore it was the las=
t Sunday with a cantata performance before a celebration of the Annunciatio=
n, Palm Sunday and the vespers service on Good Friday and Easter.[27] The p=
rescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the =
Corinthians, "praise of love" (1 Corinthians 13:1=E2=80=9313), and from the=
 Gospel of Luke, healing the blind near Jericho (Luke 18:31=E2=80=9343). Th=
e Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in=
 Jerusalem, and that the disciples do not understand what he is saying.

The cantata text is the usual combination of Bible quotation, free contempo=
rary poetry and as closing chorale a stanza from a hymn as an affirmation. =
An unknown poet chose from the Gospel verses 31 and 34 as the text for move=
ment 1, and wrote a sequence of aria, recitative and aria for the following=
 movements. His poetic text places the Christian in general, including the =
listener at Bach's time or any time, in the situation of the disciples: he =

The closing chorale is stanza 5 of Elisabeth Cruciger's "Herr Christ, der e=
inig Gotts Sohn",[28] intensifying the prayer,[29] on a melody from the Loc=
hamer-Liederbuch.[30]

Stylistic comparisons with other works by Bach suggest that the same poet w=
rote the texts for both audition cantatas and also for the two first cantat=
as which Bach performed when taking up his office.[31] The poetry for the s=
econd aria has an unusually long first section, which Bach handled elegantl=
y by repeating only part of it in the da capo.[32]

Structure and scoring
Bach structured the cantata in five movements, and scored it for three voca=
l soloists (an alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir (SATB),=
 and for a Baroque orchestra of an oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viol</div>
