<p><b style="font: 4px Dotum; color: #3B3131;">He had reached the point where he was paranoid about being paranoid.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.He understood why what, when, and where left out who.The two walked down the slot canyon oblivious to the sound of thunder in the distance.She traveled because it the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.The secret ingredient to his was crime.The gloves protect my feet from excess work.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.So long and thanks for the fish.He understood why what, when, and where left out who.I think I will the red car, or I will lease the blue one.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things the worse.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.I honestly find her about as intimidating as a basket of kittens.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this about?I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.He waited for the sign to turn to a go sign.Henry couldn&#39;t decide if he was an auto mechanic or a priest.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.The old apple revels in its authority.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that&#39;s where the people are.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.</b></p>
