<p><b style="font: 8.5px Lucida Sans Typewriter; color: #000000;">He ran out of , so he had to playing poker.Bill ran from the giraffe toward the dolphin.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.We have young kids who often walk into our room at night for various reasons including clowns in the closet.I&#39;d always thought lightning was something I could see.Edith could decide if she should paint her teeth or brush her nails.Nothing seemed out of place except the washing machine in the bar.It&#39;s comforting to know that your fate depends on something as unpredictable as the popping of corn.He took one look at what was under the table and noped the hell out of there.He always wore his sunglasses at night.You have no right to yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a lockpick.It was the first time he had ever seen someone cook dinner on an elephant.The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance.She saw no irony asking me to change but wanting me to accept her for who she is.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.He had a stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.The tree fell unexpectedly short.Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.He decided to live his lifeby the big beats manifesto.She traveled because it the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.The tour bus was packed with teenage girls heading toward their next adventure.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.The bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny&#39;s head by mere millimeters.Kevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.Watching the geriatric men&rsquo;s softball team brought back memories of 3 yr olds playing t-ball.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.</b></p>
