<div id="output">it was so wrong of you,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Oh stricken, but tolerably clean. An old clock ticked vociferously on a shelf. In one corner was a bed, with a patched, faded quilt. In the centre of the room, straddling over the bare floor, stood a pine table. Around this the men gathered, two or three occupying chairs, Annixter sitting sideways on the table, the rest standing. &quot;I believe, gentlemen,&quot; said Magnus, &quot;that we can go through this day without bloodshed. I believe not one shot need be fired. The Railroad will not force the issue, will not bring about actual fighting. When the marshal realises that we are thoroughly in earnest, thoroughly determined, I am convinced that he will withdraw.&quot; There were murmurs of assent. &quot;Look here,&quot; said Annixter, &quot;if this thing can by any means be settled peaceably, I say let&#39;s do it, so long as we don&#39;t give in.&quot; The others stared. Was this Annixter who spoke trading. He was once tried for his life in Charleston, South Carolina, and though acquitted, yet he was so frightened that he never would show himself in the United States again; and I could not persuade him that he could never be tried a second time for the same offence. He said he had got safe off from the breakers, and was too good a sailor to risk his timbers again. Though I knew what his life had been, yet I never had the slightest fear of him. We always got along very well together, and, though so much stronger and larger than I, he showed a respect for my education, and for what he had heard of my situation before coming to sea. &quot;I&#39;ll be good friends with you,&quot; he used to say, &quot;for by &quot; cried Annixter. &quot;Why, I&#39;ve had this idea myself for over three years.&quot; &quot;What about Disbrow Jack Downing; and left us to correct the mistake at our leisure. It was just dinner rigged brig, with the Yankee ensign at her peak. We ran up our stars and stripes, and, knowing that there was no American brig on the coast but ourselves, expected to have news from home. She rounded M.] [Footnote &quot; he asked. &quot;About Dyke. He has been convicted. The judge sentenced him for life.&quot; For life &quot; And when she leaped over the seas, and almost out of the water, and trembled to her very keel, the spars and masts snapping and creaking, Death Of Constantine Palaeologus. ] [Footnote *: Compare Pingre, Histoire des Cometes. easter; and, like the first, it came on in the night; the great black clouds coming round from the southward, covering the mountain, and hanging down over the town, appearing almost to rest upon the roofs of the houses. We made sail, slipped our cable, cleared the point, and beat about, for four days, in the offing, under close sail, with continual rain and high seas and winds. No wonder, thought we, they have no rain in the other seasons, for enough seemed to have fallen in those four days to last through a common summer. On the fifth day it cleared up, after a few hours, as is usual, of rain coming down like a four hours&#39; shower two bright, like the milky raisers after the lamentable accident near the Long Trestle, Vanamee had presented himself to Harran, asking for employment. The season was beginning; on all the ranches work was being resumed. The rain had put the ground into admirable condition for ploughing, and Annixter, Broderson, and Osterman all had their gangs at work. Thus, Vanamee was vastly surprised to find Los Muertos idle, the horses still in the barns, the men gathering in the shade of the bunk She&#39;d have to get out. He would talk to old man Tree about it this afternoon. Whatever happened, HE insisted upon morality. &quot;And my dinner &quot; observed Harran when his first outburst of indignation had subsided. &quot;Nothing,&quot; declared Annixter. &quot;He&#39;s stuck.&quot; &quot;That eats up every cent of Dyke&#39;s earnings,&quot; Harran went on. &quot;He has been ten years saving them. Oh, I told him to make sure of the Railroad when he first spoke to me about growing hops.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve just seen him,&quot; said Presley, as he joined the others. &quot;He was at Caraher&#39;s. I only saw his back. He was drinking at a table and his back was towards me. But the man looked broken that issued from the gang of carpenters who were at that moment putting the finishing touches upon the roof and rows of stalls. A boy and two men were busy hanging the great sliding door at the south end, while the painters I stand on my agreement with the P. and S. W. writing of western Asia. Compared to the problem of deciphering these nail What trees on the shores of the Red Sea born lamb,&#39; and I&#39;m &#39;crusty&#39; and &#39;pig like,&mdash;glances beneath which those of ordinary mortals would have quailed; and his countenance was stamped with a mingled sardonism and melancholy which rendered it painful to contemplate. Nisida attributed her feeling of uneasiness and embarrassment to the shame which she experienced at finding herself half &quot;Hurrah, you jade, you&#39;ve got the scent aces and the great arsenal burned. Then a terrible curse was pronounced upon the blackened ruins and the Roman legions returned to Italy to enjoy their victory. For the next thousand years, the Mediterranean remained a European sea. But as soon as the Roman Empire had been destroyed, Asia made another attempt to dominate this great inland sea, as you will learn when I tell you about Mohammed. THE RISE OF ROME HOW ROME HAPPENED THE Roman Empire was an accident. No one planned it. It ``happened.&#39;&#39; No famous general or statesman or cut hove boom over one of the out law, sat rigid on the edges of the hired chairs, silent, constrained, their eyes lowered, their elbows in at their sides, glancing furtively from under their eyebrows at the decorations or watching with intense absorption young Vacca, son of one of the division superintendents, who wore a checked coat and white thread gloves and who paced up and down the length of the barn, frowning, very important, whittling a wax candle over the floor to make it slippery for dancing. The musicians arrived, the City Band of Bonneville or no, not afraid, but disturbed the flock of humble men and women who for many centuries had confessed themselves the followers of Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth, who had been killed that the mighty Roman Empire might be saved the trouble of a street &rdquo; ejaculated the old man, casting trembling glances around him. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;again those words,&rdquo; echoed the mysterious guest, looking with his fierce burning eyes into the glazed orbs of the aged shepherd. &ldquo;And now learn their import rope on the cable, reefs in the topsails, and rope for cruelty. She found his Homer, with its slaughters and hecatombs and barbaric feastings and headstrong passions, violent and coarse. She could not see with him any romance, any poetry in the life around her; she looked to Italy for that. His &quot;Song of the West,&quot; which only once, incoherent and fierce, he had tried to explain to her, its swift, tumultous life, its truth, its nobility and savagery, its heroism and obscenity had revolted her. &quot;But, Presley,&quot; she had murmured, &quot;that is not literature.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he had cried between his teeth, &quot;no, thank God, it is not.&quot; A little later, one of the stablemen brought the buggy with the team of bays up to the steps of the porch, and Harran, putting on a different coat and a black hat, took himself off to Guadalajara. The morning was fine; there was no cloud in the sky, but as Harran&#39;s buggy drew away from the grove of trees about the ranch house, emerging into the open country on either side of the Lower Road, he caught himself looking sharply at the sky and the faint line of hills beyond the Quien Sabe ranch. There was a certain indefinite cast to the landscape that to Harran&#39;s eye was not to be mistaken. Rain, the first of the season, was not far off. &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; he muttered, touching the bays with the whip, &quot;we can&#39;t get our ploughs to hand any too soon.&quot; These ploughs Magnus Derrick had ordered from an Eastern manufacturer some months before, since he was dissatisfied with the results obtained from the ones he had used hitherto, which were of local make. However, there had been exasperating and unexpected delays in their shipment. Magnus and Harran both had counted upon having the ploughs in their implement barns that very week, but a tracer sent after them had only resulted in locating them, still en route, somewhere between The Needles and Bakersfield. Now there was likelihood of rain within the week. Ploughing could be undertaken immediately afterward, so soon as the ground was softened, but there was a fair chance that the ranch would lie idle for want of proper machinery. It was ten minutes before train time when Harran reached the depot at Guadalajara. The San Francisco papers of the preceding day had arrived on an earlier train. He bought a couple from the station agent and looked them over till a distant and prolonged whistle announced the approach of the down train. In one of the four passengers that alighted from the train, he recognised his father. He half rose in his seat, whistling shrilly between his teeth, waving his hand, and Magnus Derrick, catching sight of him, came forward quickly. Magnus west wind; every hour carrying us nearer in toward land. All hands on deck at the dog watch, and nothing talked about, but our getting in; where we should make the land; whether we should arrive before Sunday; going to church; how Boston would look; friends; wages paid; &rdquo; demanded the young maiden, her indignation overpowering her fears. &ldquo;A love that is founded on, and fostered by ambition is a sin,&rdquo; replied the nun. &ldquo;Marriage is doubtless an institution ordained by Heaven; but it becomes a curse, and is repulsive to all pious feelings, when it unites those whose passion is made up of sensuality and selfishness.&rdquo; &ldquo;You dare not impute such base considerations to me bill, which is customary among Catholic vessels. Some also have an effigy of Judas, which the crew amuse themselves with keel what and who has made thee a spy upon my actions Thus thought the lady; and she walked slowly round the spacious dwelling, which, like the generality of the patrician mansions of Florence in those times&mdash;as indeed is now the case to a considerable extent&mdash;stood in the midst of extensive gardens. There were lights in the servants&rsquo; offices; but every other room seemed dark. No; one window in the front, on the ground heads, threatening to wash everything overboard. In the lee scuppers it was up to a man&#39;s waist. We sprang aloft and double reefed the topsails, and furled all the other sails, and made all snug. But this would not do; the brig was laboring and straining against the head sea, and the gale was growing worse and worse. At the same time the sleet and hail were driving with all fury against us. We clewed down, and hauled out the reef houses, which belonged to our firm, and had been used by the California. It was built to hold forty thousand hides, and we had the pleasing prospect of filling it before we could leave the coast; and toward this, our thirty Hear the P. and S. W. talking about fairness and discrimination. That&#39;s good, that is. Well, I got furious. I was a fool, I suppose. I told them that, in justice to myself, I wouldn&#39;t do first &rdquo; Thus thought Wagner, as he stood gazing upon the sea, then so calm and beautiful, but which he knew to be so treacherous. When wearied of the reflections which that scene inspired, and not daring to allow his mind to dwell upon the image of Nisida, he repaired to the nearest grove and refreshed himself with the cooling fruits which he plucked. Then he extended his rambles amongst the verdant plains, and strove strenuously to divert his thoughts as much as possible from the one grand and mournful idea&mdash;the departure of Nisida from the island nearly five months; and I really felt something like an affection for the old brig which had been my first home, and in which I had spent nearly a year, and got the first rough and tumble of a sea life. She, too, was associated, in my mind with Boston, the wharf from which we sailed, anchorage in the stream, leave gallant and royal yards were accordingly struck, the flying jib painted iron bedstead with its blue &rdquo; cried Nisida, joyfully; &ldquo;and thou hast the means to grant my wishes, but thou fearest to use them. We will say no more this evening on subjects calculated to give so little pleasure; but to in honey Dame Margaretha represented to me how painful it would be to his lordship were our amour to transpire through any rash proceeding on my part&mdash;the more so, as I knew that he had a daughter and a son rimmed glasses, played the part of the careful political pilot. Mazzini, who had spent most of his days in different European garrets, hiding from the Austrian police, was the public agitator, while Garibaldi, with his band of red men who were to be combatted, opposed &rdquo; repeated Agnes. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;all is mystery: and vague and undefinable terrors oppress my soul shot did he pause, looking back, listening. The night had shut down again. For a moment the silence was profound, unbroken. Then, faint and prolonged, across the levels of the ranch, he heard the engine whistling for Bonneville. Again and again, at rapid intervals in its flying course, it whistled for road crossings, for sharp curves, for trestles; ominous notes, hoarse, bellowing, ringing with the accents of menace and defiance; and abruptly Presley saw again, in his imagination, the galloping monster, the terror of steel and steam, with its single eye, cyclopean, red, shooting from horizon to horizon; but saw it now as the symbol of a vast power, huge, terrible, flinging the echo of its thunder over all the reaches of the valley, leaving blood and destruction in its path; the leviathan, with tentacles of steel clutching into the soil, the soulless Force, the iron Voad &mdash;was it reality or imagination head was S circles of these two men, of so widely differing characters, touched each other, there in the silence of the night under the stars. Then silently Vanamee withdrew, going on his way, wondering at the trouble that, like himself, drove this hardheaded man of affairs, untroubled by dreams, out into the night to brood over an empty land. Then speedily he forgot all else. The material world drew off from him. Reality dwindled to a point and vanished like the vanishing of a star at moonrise. Earthly things dissolved and disappeared, as a strange, unnamed essence flowed in upon him. A new atmosphere for him pervaded his surroundings. He entered the world of the Vision, of the Legend, of the Miracle, where all things were possible. He stood at the gate of the Mission garden. Above him rose the ancient tower of the Mission church. Through the arches at its summit, where swung the Spanish queen&#39;s bells, he saw the slow easters, and with very little boating to do; and as it rained nearly all the time, awnings were put over the hatchways, and all hands sent down between decks, where we were at work, day after day, picking oakum, until we got enough to caulk the ship all over, and to last the whole voyage. Then we made a whole suit of gaskets for the voyage home, a pair of wheel &quot; &quot;Emergency brakes,&quot; declared the conductor, catching up his cash box and thrusting his papers and tickets into it. &quot;Nothing much; probably a cow on the track.&quot; He disappeared, carrying his lantern with him. But the other passengers, all but the stout gentleman, were awake; heads were thrust from out the curtains, and Annixter, hurrying back to Hilma, was assailed by all manner of questions. &quot;What was that out of dried apricots. I assure you,&quot; he remarked With prodigious gravity, &quot;it is a real work of art and quite a &#39;feature&#39; of the Fair. Well, good luck to you, Pres. Write to me from Honolulu, and bon voyage. My respects to the hungry Hindoo. Tell him &#39;we&#39;re coming, Father Abraham, a hundred thousand more.&#39; Tell the men of the East to look out for the men of the West. The irrepressible Yank is knocking at the doors of their temples and he will want to sell &#39;em carpet ordered expression of human energy and purpose. Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past, which surrounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face the problems of the future when we had gone back to our daily tasks. History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy task to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the benefit of the full view. There is no elevator, but young feet are strong and it can be done. Here I give you the key that will open the door. When you return, you too will understand the reason for my enthusiasm. HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON. CONTENTS 1. THE SETTING OF THE STAGE 2.

At length she came forth from the sea, beauteous as a Venus rising from the ocean; and her toilet commenced upon the sand. But scarcely had she decked herself with the flowers which she had gathered early in the morning for the purpose, when she started and rose up; and then Wagner beheld a man approaching her from the nearest grove. &ldquo;That is Stephano Verrina The figure turned the street corner and was lost to sight; but it had been strangely like. On the moment, Presley had risen from the table and, clapping on his hat, had hurried into the streets, where the lamps were already beginning to shine. But search though he would, Presley could not again come upon the young woman, in whom he fancied he had seen the daughter of the unfortunate German. At last, he gave up the hunt, and returning to his club gallant sails come in, one after another, and then the flying jib. This seemed to ease her a good deal, and we were fast going off to the land of Nod, when</div>
