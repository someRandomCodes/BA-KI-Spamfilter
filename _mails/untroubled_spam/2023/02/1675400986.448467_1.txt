Whether or not you believe in God, this message is a "must-read"!
All thr=
oughout time, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to t=
his point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Did you know t=
hat the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?
In Revelat=
ion 13:16-18, we read,
"He (the false prophet who deceives many by his mi=
racles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and great, rich and poor=
, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreh=
eads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the=

name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him =
who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for it is the nu=
mber of a man: His number is 666."
Speaking to the last generation, this =
could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells=
 us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark of the beast. I=
f physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell with one another =
without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scripture that states w=
e need the mark
to buy or sell!
These verses could not be referring to =
something purely spiritual as
scripture references two physical locations=
 (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be on one "OR" the ot=
her. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it would indicate both places, no=
t one OR the
other.
This is where it comes together. It is shocking how=
 accurate the Bible
is concerning the implantable RFID microchip. These a=
re notes from a
man named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineer=
s to help
develop this RFID chip
"Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New Wor=
ld Order meetings with
heads-of-state officials such as Henry Kissinger a=
nd Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to discuss plans on how to bring about this on=
e-world system.
The government commissioned Carl Sanders to design a micr=
ochip for
identifying and controlling the peoples of the world=E2=80=
=94a microchip
that could be inserted under the skin with a hypodermic ne=
edle (a
quick, convenient method that would be gradually accepted by soci=
ety).
Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behind him, with U.S. grant=

monies supplied by tax dollars, took on this project and designed a
mi=
crochip that is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable through
the te=
mperature changes in our skin. Without the knowledge of the
Bible (Brothe=
r Sanders was not a Christian at the time), these
engineers spent one-and=
-a-half-million dollars doing research on the
best and most convenient pl=
ace to have the microchip inserted.
Guess what? These researchers found t=
hat the forehead and the back of
the hand (the two places the Bible says =
the mark will go) are not just
the most convenient places, but are also t=
he only viable places for
rapid, consistent temperature changes in the sk=
in to recharge the
lithium battery. The microchip is approximately seven =
millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a g=
rain of
rice. It is capable of storing pages upon pages of information ab=
out
you. All your general history, work history, criminal record, health=

history, and financial data can be stored on this chip.
Brother Sander=
s believes that this microchip, which he regretfully
helped design, is th=
e =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D spoken about in Revelation
13:16=E2=80=9318. The=
 original Greek word for =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D is =E2=80=9Ccharagma,=
=E2=80=9D
which means a =E2=80=9Cscratch or etching.=E2=80=9D It is also =
interesting to note
that the number 666 is actually a word in the origina=
l Greek. The word
is =E2=80=9Cchi xi stigma,=E2=80=9D with the last part,=
 =E2=80=9Cstigma,=E2=80=9D also meaning
=E2=80=9Cto stick or prick.=
=E2=80=9D Carl believes this is referring to a
hypodermic needle when the=
y poke into the skin to inject the
microchip."
Mr. Sanders asked a doct=
or what would happen if the lithium contained
within the RFID microchip l=
eaked into the body. The doctor replied by
saying a terrible sore would a=
ppear in that location. This is what the
book of Revelation says:
"And =
the first (angel) went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and
there f=
ell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark
of the beas=
t, and on them which worshipped his image" (Revelation
16:2).
You can r=
ead more about it here--and to also understand the mystery
behind the num=
ber 666: TRUTHBIBLE.US
[http://edu-florida.us/index.php/campaigns/mp718wr=

=
The third angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-11 states,
"Then a third ang=
el followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If
anyone worships the beast=
 and his image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he =
himself shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured=
 out full strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be tormented=
 with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the pr=
esence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever and ev=
er; and they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and his ima=
ge, and whoever
receives the mark of his name.'"
"The coming of the law=
less one (the Antichrist) is according to the
working of Satan, with all =
power, signs, and lying wonders, and with
all unrighteous deception among=
 those who perish, because they did not
receive the love of the truth, th=
at they might be saved. And for this
reason God will send them strong del=
usion, that they should believe
the lie, that they all may be condemned w=
ho did not believe the truth
but had pleasure in unrighteousness." (2 The=
ssalonians 2:9-12)"
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still involved in =
politics?
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone's name can say a =
lot
about a person. God throughout history has given names to people that=

have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack=

Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.
J=
esus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from
heaven.=
"
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q"
=
(baw-rawk)
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) =
saying
in his heart:
"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I =
will be like the
Most High."
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directl=
y to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him falling from the heights or t=
he heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights or heavens used here is Hebre=
w Strongs 1116:
"bamah"--Pronounced (bam-maw')
In Hebrew, the letter "W=
aw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U"
or "O," and it is primarily=
 used as a conjunction to join concepts
together. So to join in Hebrew po=
etry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a high place like heaven or the=
 heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter "U" or "O" would be used. So, Ba=
raq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U"
Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry similar to the styl=
e written in Isaiah, would
translate literally to "Lightning from the hei=
ghts." The word "Satan"
in Hebrew is a direct translation, therefore "Sat=
an."
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan=

fall like lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish=

Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would
s=
ay these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I
saw =
Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Mali=
a and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backward (the devil does t=
hings in reverse)
we would get "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the lett=
ers that spell
"Alah" (Allah being the false god of Islam), we get "I am =
Satan".
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Obama's campaign logo when he ra=
n in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the west, with the landscape as t=
he flag of the United States. In
Islam, they have their own messiah that =
they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (the Antichrist o=
f the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this man's appearance is the su=
n rising in the
west.
"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of =
heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the=
 earth=E2=80=94to
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying=
 with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His =
judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and=
 springs
of water.'" (Revelation 14:6-7)
Why have the words of Jesus in=
 His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, burial, and resurrection, been =
translated into over 3,000
languages, and nothing comes close (the Quran =
about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit of God (YHVH) who created a=
ll people likewise
transcends all people; therefore the power of His Word=
 is not limited
by people; while all other religions are man-made, theref=
ore they tend
to primarily stay within their own culture. The same God wh=
o speaks to
all people through His creation of the heavens and earth that=
 draws
all people around the world likewise has sent His Word to the ends=
 of
the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to be saved in=

spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.
Jesus stands alone a=
mong the other religions that say to rightly weigh
the scales of good and=
 evil and to make sure you have done more good
than bad in this life. Is =
this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court of law? Bearing the image=
 of God, is this how we project this
image into reality?
Our good works=
 cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty
of a crime, the =
judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but
rather by the crime=
s we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,
created in God's image, po=
se this type of justice, how much more a
perfect, righteous, and Holy God=
?
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given=

to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be
justifie=
d, but rather that we may see the need for a savior. They are
the mirror =
of God's character of what He has written in our hearts,
with our conscio=
us bearing witness that we know that it is wrong to
steal, lie, dishonor =
our parents, murder, and so forth.
We can try and follow the moral laws o=
f the 10 commandments, but we
will never catch up to them to be justified=
 before a Holy God. That
same word of the law given to Moses became flesh=
 about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our jus=
tification by
fulfilling the law, living a sinless perfect life that only=
 God could
fulfill.
The gap between us and the law can never be reconci=
led by our own
merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace =
and mercy of
God. And if we are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will=
 pull us
up being the one to justify us. As in the court of law, if someo=
ne
steps in and pays our fine, even though we are guilty, the judge can=

do what is legal and just and let us go free. That is what Jesus did
a=
lmost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction being
fulf=
illed in the spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood with His
last w=
ord's on the cross crying out, "It is finished!" (John 19:30).
For God ta=
kes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23).
This is why i=
n Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming
Messiah and His soul b=
eing a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it
pleased God to crush His on=
ly begotten Son.
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified =
by being
poured out upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we =
would
all perish to hell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring =
it
out on His Son whose soul could not be left in Hades but was raised
=
and seated at the right hand of God in power.
So now when we put on the L=
ord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God
no longer sees the person who =
deserves His wrath, but rather the
glorious image of His perfect Son dwel=
ling in us, justifying us as if
we received the wrath we deserve, making =
a way of escape from the
curse of death; now being conformed into the ima=
ge of the heavenly man
walking in a new nature, and no longer in the imag=
e of the fallen man
Adam.
Now what we must do is repent and put our tru=
st and faith in the
savior, confessing and forsaking our sins, and to rec=
eive His Holy
Spirit that we may be born again (for Jesus says we must be=
 born again
to see and enter the Kingdom of God in John chapter 3). This =
is not
just head knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather receiving Hi=
s
words, taking them to heart, so that we may truly be transformed into=

the image of God. Where we no longer live to practice sin, but rather
=
turn from our sins and practice righteousness through faith in Him in
obe=
dience to His Word by reading the Bible.
Our works cannot save us, but th=
ey can condemn us; it is not that we
earn our way into everlasting life, =
but that we obey our Lord Jesus
Christ:
Jesus says,
=E2=80=9CNot ever=
yone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall enter the
kingdo=
m of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.
Many will s=
ay to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in Your=
 name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in
Your name?=
=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew you;
dep=
art from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)
"An=
d having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation
to all=
 who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, fo=
r the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no=
 more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down ou=
t of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I =
heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is =
with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God =
Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every =
tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor cryin=
g.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.'=

Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
A=
nd He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'
And He =
said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and =
the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him w=
ho thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his =
God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mu=
rderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have=
 their part in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the=
 second death.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8)

<br />
This is where it comes together. It is shocking how accurate the Bible is c=
oncerning the implantable RFID microchip. These are notes from a man named =
Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help develop this RFID =

<br />
"Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with heads-of-state=

Guess what? These researchers found that the forehead and the back of the h=
and (the two places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just the most =
convenient places, but are also the only viable places for rapid, consisten=
t temperature changes in the skin to recharge the lithium battery. The micr=
ochip is approximately seven millimeters in length, .75 millimeters in diam=
eter, about the size of a grain of rice. It is capable of storing pages upo=
n pages of information about you. All your general history, work history, c=
riminal record, health history, and financial data can be stored on this ch=
ip.<br />
<br />
Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he regretfully helped d=
esign, is the =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D spoken about in Revelation 13:16=
=E2=80=9318. The original Greek word for =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D is =

hen they poke into the skin to inject the microchip."<br />
<br />
Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen if the lithium contained withi=
n the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by saying a t=
errible sore would appear in that location. This is what the book of Revela=
tion says:<br />
<br />
"And the first (angel) went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and ther=
e fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark of the bea=

<br />
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still involved in politics?<br />
<br />
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot about a =
person. God throughout history has given names to people that have a specif=

The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q" (baw-r=
awk)<br />
<br />
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying in his=
 heart:<br />
<br />
"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most Hig=
h."<br />
<br />
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times it me=
ntions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew word for the=
 heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116: "bamah"--Pronounced (=
bam-maw')<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U" or "O=
," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts together. So =
to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq) and a high place =
like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the letter "U" or "O" would=
 be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U" Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry simil=
ar to the style written in Isaiah, would translate literally to "Lightning =
from the heights." The word "Satan" in Hebrew is a direct translation, ther=
efore "Satan."<br />
<br />
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan fall li=
ke lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish Rabbi today=
 influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would say these words i=
n Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I saw Satan as Baraq O B=
am-Maw.<br />
<br />
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we were to=
 write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse) we would get=
 "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah bei=
ng the false god of Islam), we get "I am Satan". Coincidence? I don't think=
 so.<br />
<br />
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon in the=
 west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In Islam, they =
have their own messiah that they are waiting for called the 12th Imam, or t=
he Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one prophecy concerning this ma=
n's appearance is the sun rising in the west.<br />
<br />
"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlas=
ting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to every nati=
on, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God =
and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship H=
im who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.'" (Revelation 1=
4:6-7)<br />
<br />
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His death, bur=
ial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000 languages, and nothi=
ng comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)? Because the same Spirit of =
God (YHVH) who created all people likewise transcends all people; therefore=
 the power of His Word is not limited by people; while all other religions =
are man-made, therefore they tend to primarily stay within their own cultur=
e. The same God who speaks to all people through His creation of the heaven=
s and earth that draws all people around the world likewise has sent His Wo=
rd to the ends of the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to b=
e saved in spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh the =
scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good than bad i=
n this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a court of law? Bea=
ring the image of God, is this how we project this image into reality?<br /=
>
<br />
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty of a=
 crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but rather by=
 the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's i=
mage, pose this type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Ho=
ly God?<br />
<br />
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given to Mo=
ses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be justified, but rat=
her that we may see the need for a savior. They are the mirror of God's cha=
racter of what He has written in our hearts, with our conscious bearing wit=
ness that we know that it is wrong to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, mur=
der, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we will ne=
ver catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That same word of t=
he law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago in the body of Jes=
us Christ. He came to be our justification by fulfilling the law, living a =
sinless perfect life that only God could fulfill.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own merit, bu=
t the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. And if w=
e are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us up being the one to=
 justify us. As in the court of law, if someone steps in and pays our fine,=
 even though we are guilty, the judge can do what is legal and just and let=
 us go free. That is what Jesus did almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It=
 was a legal transaction being fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shed=
ding of His blood with His last word's on the cross crying out, "It is fini=
shed!" (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). This =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to crush Hi=
s only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would all perish to h=
ell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it out on His Son whose=
 soul could not be left in Hades but was raised and seated at the right han=
d of God in power.<br />
<br />
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God no lo=
nger sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image =
of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if we received the wrat=
h we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death; now being con=
formed into the image of the heavenly man walking in a new nature, and no l=
onger in the image of the fallen man Adam.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the savior, co=
nfessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy Spirit that we may=
 be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again to see and enter the K=
ingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not just head knowledge of believ=
ing in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart, so that=
 we may truly be transformed into the image of God. Where we no longer live=
 to practice sin, but rather turn from our sins and practice righteousness =
through faith in Him in obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.<br />
<br />
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we earn o=
ur way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus Christ:<br />
<br />
Jesus says,<br />
<br />
=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall e=
nter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven=
. Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophes=
ied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Yo=
ur name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew yo=
u; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)=
<br />
<br />
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to al=
l who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8)<img width=3D"1" height=3D"1" src=3D"http://=
