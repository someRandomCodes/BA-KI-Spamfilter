<p><b style="font: 7.5px Latha; color: #463E3F;">The stranger officiates the meal.My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.On each full moonThe gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.Sometimes it is better to just walk away from things and go back to them later when you&rsquo;re in a better frame of mind.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.He learned the hardest lesson of his lif and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.She is happy until she finds something to be unhappy about; then, she is overjoyed.He decided water-skiing on a frozen lake wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.Instead of a bachelorette partyHe appeared to be confusingly perplexed.The river stole the gods.Greetings from the real universe.Peter found road kill an excellent way to on dinner.His rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain of her strangeness.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.Tomorrow will bring something , so as a memory.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.The manager of the fruit stand always sat and sold vegetables.The elephant didn&#39;t want to talk about the person in the room.He ended up burning his fingers poking someone else&#39;s fire.</b></p>
