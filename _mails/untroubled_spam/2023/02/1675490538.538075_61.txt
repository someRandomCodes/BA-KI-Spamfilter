<p><b style="font: 4px Malgun Gothic Semilight; color: #1589FF;">Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.She folded her handkerchief neatly.He decided to live his lifeby the big beats manifesto.Swim at your own risk was taken as a challenge for the group of Kansas City college students.She was by the large chunks of ice washing up on the beach.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.Just because the water is red doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t drink it.After fighting the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition.They looked up at the sky and saw a millin stars.Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy everyone.A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.It must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of minerals.Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.You bite up because of your lower jaw.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.Don&#39;t piss in my garden and tell me you&#39;re trying to help my plants grow.My uncle&#39;s favorite pastime was building cars out of noodles.That was how he came to 1 .Behind the window was a reflection that instilled fear.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.The skeleton had skeletons of his own in the closet.You&#39;re unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.</b></p>
