<p>&rdquo; exclaimed Alessandro, wild with joy, and almost doubting whether=
 he were not in the midst of a delicious dream. &ldquo;That you consent to =
be blindfolded while being conducted into her presence&mdash;that you maint=
ain the most profound silence while with those who will guide you to her ab=
ode&mdash;and that you return from the interview under the same circumstanc=
es.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should be unworthy the interest which she deigns to man=
ifest in my behalf, were I to refuse compliance with those terms,&rdquo; an=
swered Alessandro. &ldquo;An hour after sunset,&rdquo; said the spy, &ldquo=
;you will meet me at the gate of the Mosque of Selimya;&rdquo; and with tho=
se words he hurried away, leaving the young Florentine in a state of excite=
d hope, amounting to a delirium of joy. Alessandro was well aware that adve=
ntures, such as the one in which he found himself suddenly involved, were b=
y no means uncommon in the East; and that ladies of the most unimpeachable =
virtue, as well as of the highest rank, frequently accorded interviews of t=
his private nature to those men who were fortunate enough to merit their at=
tention&mdash;such visits being the first step toward matrimonial connectio=
ns. But then he remembered that he was a Christian, and the fair object of =
his devotion was probably of the Moslem faith. What, then, would be the res=
ult &rdquo; inquired the grand vizier, strangely interested in the discours=
e of his youthful page. &ldquo;It is not that he scorns my sister&rsquo;s l=
ove,&rdquo; replied Constantine; &ldquo;but it is that he knows not of its =
existence. It is true that he has seen her once&mdash;yet &rsquo;twere prob=
able that he remembers not there is such a being in the world. Thus came it=
 to pass, my lord&mdash;an officer, holding a high rank in the service of h=
is imperial majesty, the great Solyman, had occasion to visit a humble dwel=
ling wherein my sister resided. She&mdash;poor silly maiden worn woodwork t=
hat supported the ceiling. How the fire originated, Lomellino knew not, but=
 as some of the nuns carried lamps in their hands, and rushed wildly about =
in all directions in their terror, it was not very difficult to hazard a co=
njecture as to the cause of the conflagration. From that apartment, where t=
he fire began, the flames drove the combatants into an inner room, and ther=
e Lomellino saw his comrade Piero hurled down some steep place, he himself =
being too sorely pressed by his assailants to be able to repair to his assi=
stance. At length, seeing that all his companions were slain, Lomellino had=
 fought his way desperately through the police washed adobe with a flat cei=
ling, was lighted dimly by the sanctuary lamp that hung from three long cha=
ins just over the chancel rail at the far end of the church, and by two or =
three cheap kerosene lamps in brackets of imitation bronze. All around the =
walls was the inevitable series of pictures representing the Stations of th=
e Cross. They were of a hideous crudity of design and composition, yet were=
 wrought out with an innocent, unquestioning sincerity that was not without=
 its charm. Each picture framed alike in gilt, bore its suitable inscriptio=
n in staring black letters. &quot;Simon, The Cyrenean, Helps Jesus to Carry=
 His Cross.&quot; &quot;Saint Veronica Wipes the Face of Jesus.&quot; &quot=
;Jesus Falls for the Fourth Time,&quot; and so on. Half The Wheat grows its=
elf. What does he count for trough, their eyes wandering incessantly toward=
 the slow moving herd, grazing on the wheat stubble, moving southward as th=
ey grazed. &quot;Where have you come from this time grease; muscled hands, =
the knuckles whitened in their grip on the reins, and through it all the am=
moniacal smell of the horses, the bitter reek of perspiration of beasts and=
 men, the aroma of warm leather, the scent of dead stubble &rdquo; thundere=
d the voice of the forgotten Stephano, and in a moment the bandit flung him=
self upon Wagner, whom he attempted to hurl into the crystal but deep river=
 Fernand, however, caught the arm of the brigand and dragged him along wit=
h him into the water, while a terrific scream burst from the lips of Nisida=
 Then furious was the struggle that commenced in the depths of the stream.=
 But Stephano lay beneath Wagner, who held him down on the pebbly bottom. I=
n another moment Nisida herself plunged into the river with the wild hope o=
f aiding her lover to conquer his foe, or to rescue him from the grasp whic=
h the bandit maintained upon him with the tenacity that was strengthened ra=
ther than impaired by the agony of suffocation. But she rose again to the s=
urface in an instant by the indomitable influence of that instinct for self=
 head at once, the larboard watch hoisting the fore, the starboard watch th=
e main, and five light hands, (of whom I was one,) picked from the two watc=
hes, the mizen. The yards were then trimmed, the anchor weighed, the cat th=
e listlessness of great fatigue. &quot;Well, well,&quot; observed the other=
 &quot;I&#39;m right sorry to hear that. What&#39;s the trouble, Pres reli=

sque of the Sultan Solyman, forming an exact square with four noble towers =
at the angles, and with its huge cupola, in the midst; the mosque of the Su=
ltan Ahmed, with its numerous domes, its tall minarets, and its colonnades =
supported by marble pillars; and the mosque of the Sultana Valida, or queen=
 mother of Mohammed the Fourth, exceeding all other Mussulman churches in t=
he delicacy of its architecture and the beauty of its columns of marble and=
 jasper, supplied by the ruins of Troy&mdash;these are the most remarkable =
temples in the capital of the Ottoman empire. The Grand Bezestein, or excha=
nge, is likewise a magnificent structure&mdash;consisting of a spacious hal=
l of circular form, built of free breeze set in, which brought us upon a ta=
ught bowline. Among our passengers was a young man who was the best represe=
ntation of a decayed gentleman I had ever seen. He reminded me much of some=
 of the characters in Gil Blas. He was of the aristocracy of the country, h=
is family being of pure Spanish blood, and once of great importance in Mexi=
co. His father had been governor of the province, and having amassed a larg=
e property, settled at San Diego, where he built a large house with a court=

Captain Bradshaw to take him on board the ship. Just behind the hide nine d=

 his faithful servant. From that moment on, Siddhartha was called Buddha an=

 adventurers, who hoisted the sails of flight, and were soon scattered roun=
d the coasts of the Mediterranean. But a veteran band of fifteen hundred Ca=
talans, or French, stood firm in the strong fortress of Gallipoli on the He=
llespont, displayed the banners of Arragon, and offered to revenge and just=
ify their chief, by an equal combat of ten or a hundred warriors. Instead o=
f accepting this bold defiance, the emperor Michael, the son and colleague =
of Andronicus, resolved to oppress them with the weight of multitudes: ever=
y nerve was strained to form an army of thirteen thousand horse and thirty =
thousand foot; and the Propontis was covered with the ships of the Greeks a=
nd Genoese. In two battles by sea and land, these mighty forces were encoun=
tered and overthrown by the despair and discipline of the Catalans: the you=
ng emperor fled to the palace; and an insufficient guard of light &rdquo; e=
jaculated Wagner, raising his head. &ldquo;That girl&mdash;oh Hand over han=

 ready, the boom topped up, preventer guys rove, and the idlers called up t=
o man the halyards; yet such was still the force of the gale, that we were =
nearly an hour setting the sail; carried away the outhaul in doing it, and =
came very near snapping off the swinging boom. No sooner was it set than th=
e ship tore on again like one that was mad, and began to steer as wild as a=
 hawk. The men at the wheel were puffing and blowing at their work, and the=
 helm was going hard up and hard down, constantly. Add to this, the gale di=
d not lessen as the day came on, but the sun rose in clouds. A sudden lurch=
 threw the man from the weather wheel across the deck and against the side.=

ger awoke the old man from his charming dream, during which he had never on=
ce thought of the conditions whereby he was to purchase the complete realiz=
ation of the vision. &ldquo;Oh &mdash;of her recovery from that dreadful af=

have fathomed the secrets of the closet, and have become acquainted with th=

hol. Never in his life had he been drunk. He prided himself upon his power =
of resistance. It was his nature. &quot;Say &quot; was sounded down the for=

black cloud rolling on toward us from the south oh, I&#39;m all mixed up. I=
&#39;m so nervous and trembly now. Oh,&quot; she cried suddenly, her face o=

quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know what he is waiting for,&quot; answered Harran.=
 &quot;He was to have come in just after me. He thought maybe the marshal&#=

r Road, after all. He wanted to watch them a little longer. But he ought to=
 be here now.&quot; &quot;Think he&#39;ll take a shot at them on his own ac=

the breeze became stiff, and the royal masts bent under our sails, but we w=

 of the California; when they were all furled at once, but with orders to s=

returned, without so much as a clue. Upon no one could even the shadow of s=
uspicion be thrown. The Other had withdrawn into an impenetrable mystery. T=
here he remained. He never was found; he never was so much as heard of. A l=
egend arose about him, this prowler of the night, this strange, fearful fig=

 gone in an instant, but leaving behind him a track of terror and death and=
 rage and undying grief. Within the year, in giving birth to the child, Ang=
