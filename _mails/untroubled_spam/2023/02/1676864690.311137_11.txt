			<p style="text-align: center;">The telescope was invented by Johns Hopkins University and released on July 1.<br />


			<br />


			The purpose of this study is to achieve maximum magnification at the smallest effective aperture while ensuring the luminous flux and resolution angle of the telescope.<br />


			<br />


			<strong>This telescope is the first attempt to use nano-etching technology</strong>, nano-array technology, mesoporous assembly technology, thin-film mosaic technology, and nano-optical materials to make the flatness error of the lens reach 10nm.<br />


			<br />


			<strong>The luminous flux reaches 30 times that of ordinary telescopes with the same diameter</strong>. <strong>The resolution angle is 47 times</strong> that of ordinary telescopes with the same diameter.<br />

<p><b style="font: 7px Estrangelo Edessa; color: #616D7E;">I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.Situps are a terrible way to end your day.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.The door slammed on the watermelon.She tilted her head back and let whip cream stream into her mouth while taking a bath.Erin accidentally created a universe.The small white buoys marked the location of hundreds of crab pots.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.We need to rent a room for our party.He put heat on the wound to see what would grow.Mary plays the piano.I&#39;m confused: when people ask me what&#39;s up, and I point, they groan.I used to live in my neighbor&#39;s fishpond, but the aesthetic wasn&#39;t to my taste.Eating eggs on Thursday for choir practice was recommended.The of a passed before him as he tried to decide between a cone or a cup.You&#39;ve been eyeing me day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.Sometimes you have to just give up and by cheating.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.Best friends are like old tomatoes and shoelaces.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.Watching the geriatric men&rsquo;s softball team brought back memories of 3 yr olds playing t-ball.Red is greener than purple, for sure.He hated that he loved what she hated about hate.I&#39;ve seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine.</b></p>
