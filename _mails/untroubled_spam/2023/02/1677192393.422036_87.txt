						<td colspan="2" style="background-color:#ffffff"><span style="color:#ffffff; font-family:constantia,lucida bright,dejavu serif,georgia,serif; font-size:10px">highlights amidst unexpected better tracks from various solo projects. Og to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young&#39;s material earmarked for the box. Ultimately, nine tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were ed to CSNY. Intended for inclusion, the 1976 CSNY version of &quot;Human Highway&quot; was leaked to the internet several years later before receiving an official release on the Neil Young Archives Volume II: 1972&ndash;1976 box set in 2020. In 1994, CSN collaborated with Suzy Bogguss, Alison Krauss, and Kathy Mattea to contribute &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. By the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, Looking Forward. The album was released at Young&#39;s behest[citation needed] via Reprise Records in October 1999. With writing s mostly limited to band s, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at No. 26 (the group&#39;s highest chart placement since American Dream) during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, Looking Forward was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major -makers. CSN were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its s inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by actor and comedian Phil Hartman during his first career as a graphic designer. Various compilations of the band&#39;s configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and So Far being the most commercially ful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby&#39;s Voyage chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash&#39;s Reflections appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, Carry On, was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash. One of the backdrops during the 2006 &quot;dom of Speech&quot; tour, as shown , was the photos of American soldiers who h died in the war in Iraq. </span><br />

<div id="output">As if you and Genslinger and S. Behrman didn&#39;t run the whole show down here. Come on, let&#39;s have it, Ruggles. What does S. Behrman pay Genslinger for inserting that three-inch ad. of the P. and S. W. in his paper &rdquo; exclaimed Antonio, delighted with this assurance; &ldquo;and now I can speak fearlessly and frankly. My informant is that other bandit who accompanied Stephano Verrina and Lomellino when the countess, Flora, and the marquis were conducted blindfold from the robbers&rsquo; stronghold. But while they were yet all inmates of that stronghold, this same bandit, whose name is Venturo, overheard the marquis inform Stephano Verrina that he intended to remain in Florence to obtain the liberation of a Jew who was imprisoned in the dungeons of the inquisition: and this Jew, Venturo also learnt by subsequent inquiry from Verrina, is a certain Isaachar ben Solomon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Isaachar ben Solomon I can&#39;t be everywhere. What do I feed you for if it ain&#39;t to look after things I can&#39;t attend to Now, we want you with us, Governor; perhaps not openly, if you don&#39;t wish it, but tacitly, at least. I won&#39;t ask you for an answer to-night, but what I do ask of you is to consider this matter seriously and think over the whole business. Will you do it &quot; was the by-word everywhere, and it had even reached California, though there were still many here, among whom was Don Juan Bandini, who were opposed to his government, and intriguing to bring in Bustamente. Santa Ana, they said, was for breaking down the missions; or, as they termed it--&quot;Santa Ana no quiere religion.&quot; Yet I had no doubt that the office of administrador of San Diego would reconcile Don Juan to any dynasty, and any state of the church. In these papers, too, I found scraps of American and English news; but which were so unconnected, and I was so ignorant of everything preceding them for eighteen months past, that they only awakened a curiosity which they could not satisfy. One article spoke of Taney as Justicia Mayor de los Estados Unidos, (what had become of Marshall &quot; says the captain; &quot;tacks and sheets &quot; &quot;No, they&#39;ve stopped. False alarm.&quot; &quot;They&#39;ve not, either. Why don&#39;t we move Oh, yes, too funny for any use. I&#39;d laugh a little louder if I was you.&quot; &quot;Well, Buck,&quot; protested Harran, as he noticed the hat in Annixter&#39;s hand, &quot;you&#39;re not going home just for----&quot; Annixter turned on him with a shout. &quot;I&#39;ll get plumb out of here,&quot; he trumpeted. &quot;I won&#39;t stay here another minute.&quot; He swung into his waistcoat and coat, scrabbling at the buttons in the violence of his emotions. &quot;And I don&#39;t know but what it will make me sick again to go out in a night like this. NO, I won&#39;t stay. Some things are funny, and then, again, there are some things that are not. Ah, yes, sloop Then did she recall to mind every interchange of thought that had passed between them through the language of the fingers; and she could fix upon nothing which, emanating from herself, had given him offense. Had he then really lost his senses when the Assyrian king, as he rose the next day, found a hundred fourscore and five thousand dead bodies, and when he, with the remainder of his army, fled away from the Hebrews, though they were unarmed, and did not pursue them. You are also acquainted with the slavery we were under at Babylon, where the people were captives for seventy years; yet were they not delivered into freedom again before God made Cyrus his gracious instrument in bringing it about; accordingly they were set free by him, and did again restore the worship of their Deliverer at his temple. And, to speak in general, we can produce no example wherein our fathers got any success by war, or failed of success when without war they committed themselves to God. When they staid at home, they conquered, as pleased their Judge; but when they went out to fight, they were always disappointed: for example, when the king of Babylon besieged this very city, and our king Zedekiah fought against him, contrary to what predictions were made to him by Jeremiah the prophet, he was at once taken prisoner, and saw the city and the temple demolished. Yet how much greater was the moderation of that king, than is that of your present governors, and that of the people then under him, than is that of you at this time Sey, den, dose vellers, hev dey hurdt my men, eh, whadt &quot; in the same tones, and with the same orders following them, seemed to bring us directly back to our old position of the week before. During our watch on deck, which was from twelve to four, the wind came out ahead, with a pelting storm of hail and sleet, and we lay hove-to, under a close-reefed main topsail, the whole watch. During the next watch it fell calm, with a drenching rain, until daybreak, when the wind came out to the westward, and the weather cleared up, and showed us the whole ocean, in the course which we should have steered, had it not been for the head wind and calm, completely blocked up with ice. Here then our progress was stopped, and we wore ship, and once more stood to the northward and eastward; not for the straits of Magellan, but to make another attempt to double the Cape, still farther to the eastward; for the captain was determined to get round if perseverance could do it; and the third time, he said, never failed. With a fair wind we soon ran clear of the field-ice, and by noon had only the stray islands floating far and near upon the ocean. The sun was out bright, the sea of a deep blue, fringed with the white foam of the waves which ran high before a strong south-wester; our solitary ship tore on through the water, as though glad to be out of her confinement; and the ice islands lay scattered upon the ocean here and there, of various sizes and shapes, reflecting the bright rays of the sun, and drifting slowly northward before the gale. It was a contrast to much that we had lately seen, and a spectacle not only of beauty, but of life; for it required but little fancy to imagine these islands to be animate masses which had broken loose from the &quot;thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice,&quot; and were working their way, by wind and current, some alone, and some in fleets, to milder climes. No pencil has ever yet given anything like the true effect of an iceberg. In a picture, they are huge, uncouth masses, stuck in the sea, while their chief beauty and grandeur,--their slow, stately motion; the whirling of the snow about their summits, and the fearful groaning and cracking of their parts,--the picture cannot give. This is the large iceberg; while the small and distant islands, floating on the smooth sea, in the light of a clear day, look like little floating fairy isles of sapphire. From a north-east course we gradually hauled to the eastward, and after sailing about two hundred miles, which brought us as near to the western coast of Terra del Fuego as was safe, and having lost sight of the ice altogether,--for the third time we put the ship&#39;s head to the southward, to try the passage of the Cape. The weather continued clear and cold, with a strong gale from the westward, and we were fast getting up with the latitude of the Cape, with a prospect of soon being round. One fine afternoon, a man who had gone into the fore-top to shift the rolling tackles, sung out, at the top of his voice, and with evident glee,--&quot;Sail ho and that we have compelled Fortune herself to watch over the prosperity of our empire. What is the foundation of thy insolence and folly O Agnes&mdash;my darling since very foreigners and enemies do now correct that impiety which thou hast occasioned; while thou, who art a Jew, and wast educated in our laws, art become a greater enemy to them than the others. But still, John, it is never dishonorable to repent, and amend what hath been done amiss, even at the last extremity. Thou hast an instance before thee in Jechoniah, (7) the king of the Jews, if thou hast a mind to save the city, who, when the king of Babylon made war against him, did of his own accord go out of this city before it was taken, and did undergo a voluntary captivity with his family, that the sanctuary might not be delivered up to the enemy, and that he might not see the house of God set on fire; on which account he is celebrated among all the Jews, in their sacred memorials, and his memory is become immortal, and will be conveyed fresh down to our posterity through all ages. This, John, is an excellent example in such a time of danger, and I dare venture to promise that the Romans shall still forgive thee. And take notice that I, who make this exhortation to thee, am one of thine own nation; I, who am a Jew, do make this promise to thee. And it will become thee to consider who I am that give thee this counsel, and whence I am derived; for while I am alive I shall never be in such slavery, as to forego my own kindred, or forget the laws of our forefathers. Thou hast indignation at me again, and makest a clamor at me, and reproachest me; indeed I cannot deny but I am worthy of worse treatment than all this amounts to, because, in opposition to fate, I make this kind invitation to thee, and endeavor to force deliverance upon those whom God hath condemned. And who is there that does not know what the writings of the ancient prophets contain in them, - and particularly that oracle which is just now going to be fulfilled upon this miserable city &quot; he said, when Presley had sat down. &quot;He&#39;s in the new politics with a vengeance, isn&#39;t he Moreover, such appears to be the sad and benighted state of his mind, that he might peradventure deem the tale relative to Eugenio a mere excuse and vile subterfuge. No; I must perish disgraced in his eyes, unless he should accord ere I die, the interview which yourself and the good Dr. Duras have so vainly implored him to grant me.&rsquo; &ldquo;Our dear mother then proceeded to give me other instructions, Francisco, relative to yourself; but these,&rdquo; added Nisida, glancing toward Flora, &ldquo;would now be painful to unfold. And yet,&rdquo; she continued, hastily, as a second thought struck her, &ldquo;it is impossible, my sweet Flora, that you can be weak-minded&mdash;for you have this day seen and heard enough to test your mental powers to the extreme possibility of their endurance. Moreover, I feel that my conduct toward you requires a complete justification; and that justification will be found in the last instructions which I received from the lips of my mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dearest Nisida,&rdquo; said the young countess, &ldquo;no justification is needed&mdash;no apology is required in reference to that subject; for your kind words, your altered manner toward me now, your recognition of me as a sister, made so by union with your brother&mdash;oh &quot; A few moments served to loose the topsails, which were furled with reefs, to sheet them home, and hoist them up. &quot;Bear a hand Was it possible he was AFRAID to face those hired villifiers &rdquo; exclaimed the grand inquisitor, in a tone of fearful excitement and rage. &ldquo;We must not afford him a chance of dying upon that engine of torture. No&mdash;no: the lingering flames of the auto-da-fe are reserved for the Marquis d&rsquo;Orsini &rdquo; And Nisida replied through the same medium, &ldquo;Your happiness, dearest brother, has ever been my only study, and shall continue so.&rdquo; The physician and Father Marco, the priest, now advanced, and taking the brother and sister by the hands, led them from the chamber of death. &ldquo;Kind friends,&rdquo; said Francisco, now Count of Riverola, &ldquo;I understand you. You would withdraw my sister and myself from a scene too mournful to contemplate. Alas &quot; But at the idea of being held, the boy protested at top voice, badly frightened, bewildered, not knowing what was to happen next. &quot;No, no, I got my meat to deliver. Say, you let me go. Say, I ain&#39;t got nothing to do with you.&quot; He tugged at the reins, trying to turn the cart about. Cutter, with his jack-knife, parted the reins just back of the bit. &quot;You&#39;ll stay where you are, m&#39; son, for a while. We&#39;re not going to hurt you. But you are not going back to town till we say so. Did you pass anybody on the road out of town &quot; &quot;Do This was he who took care of my sleep, and secured me from fear of danger, who comforted me under the trouble I was in upon the slaughter of my sons, and looked to see what affection my surviving brethren bore me with such whirlwind speed along.
