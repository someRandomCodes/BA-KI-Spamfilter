<p><b style="font: 5px MV Boli; color: #4C4646;">He hated that he loved what she hated about hate.My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.Cursive writing is thebest way to build a race track.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his go.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.The stench from the feedlot permeated the car despite having the air conditioning on recycled air.You&#39;re unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.The door slammed on the watermelon.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.Abstraction is often one floor above you.Instead of a bachelorette partyMr. Montoya knows the way to the bakery even though he&#39;s been there.The river stole the gods.Random words in front of other random words create a random sentence.She looked into the mirror and saw another person.His rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.It was the sandcastle he had ever seen.Warm beer on a cold day isn&#39;t my idea of fun.She discovered van is difficult with 2 cats and a dog.The part of marriage is animal crackers with peanut butter.After fighting the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.</b></p>
