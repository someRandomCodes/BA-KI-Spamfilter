<p><b style="font: 9.5px Microsoft YaHei UI; color: #737CA1;">He had a vague sense that trees gave birth to dinosaurs.He is no James Bond; his is Roger Moore.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.He learned the important lesson that a picnic at the beach on a windy day is a bad idea.Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.Red is greener than purple, for sure.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is a matter of time.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.Weather is not trivial - it&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re standing in it.She had the gift of being able to paint songs.I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled.Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin.The skeleton had skeletons of his own in the closet.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.When he asked her favorite number, she answered without hesitation that it was diamonds.I hear that Nancy is very pretty.It turns out you don&#39;t need that stuff you insisted you did.We need to rent a room for our party.The key lime pie is still up for debate.My secretary is the person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.She looked into the mirror and saw another person.Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy everyone.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to the sewage flowing from his mouth.I&rsquo;m a living furnace.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.The wooden spoon couldn&rsquo;t cut but left emotional scars.</b></p>
