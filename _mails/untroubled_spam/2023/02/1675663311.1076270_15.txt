<p><b style="font: 7px Segoe UI Emoji; color: #2F4F4F;">A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.The llama couldn&#39;t resist trying the lemonade.We have a lot of rain in June.She was too busy always talking about what she wanted to do to actually do any of it.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.Her scream silenced the rowdy teenagers.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it to them.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.The book is in front of the table.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.He realized there had been several deaths on this road, but his concern rose when he saw the exact number.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.Combines are no longer just for farms.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.It must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.Patricia loves the sound of nails strongly pressed against the chalkboard.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.She had the gift of being able to paint songs.She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.He decided to fake his disappearance to jail.The virus had powers none of us knew existed.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.He shaved the peach to prove a point.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.Beach-combing replaced wine tasting as his obsession.</b></p>
