<p style="line-height:1.38">--This is the last pull here--No more duckings in your breakers, and slipping from your cursed south-easters Steep oneself in the heat of the desert, the glory of the sunset, the blue haze of the mesa and the canyon.&quot; &quot;As you have done, for instance &quot; They had wavered, these other Leaguers. Now, when the actual crisis impended, they were smitten with confusion. Ah, no, they were not going to stand up and be shot at just to save Derrick&#39;s land. They were not armed. What did Annixter and Osterman take them for &rdquo; &ldquo;In a few moments you shall know more &rdquo; ejaculated the old man, casting trembling glances around him. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;again those words,&rdquo; echoed the mysterious guest, looking with his fierce burning eyes into the glazed orbs of the aged shepherd. &ldquo;And now learn their import &rdquo; asked Giulia, in a voice scarcely above a whisper; for that woman who dared be unfaithful to her husband revolted from the thought that a coarse-minded bandit should be in a position to overhear her conversation with her lover:&mdash;&ldquo;how can you reproach me thus, Manuel was he the prey to fits of mental aberration which would produce so extraordinary an effect upon him lady, have pity upon me&mdash;pity upon me, a bereaved mother &quot; Lyman, Magnus&#39;s eldest son, had never taken kindly toward ranch life. He resembled his mother more than he did Magnus, and had inherited from her a distaste for agriculture and a tendency toward a profession. At a time when Harran was learning the rudiments of farming, Lyman was entering the State University, and, graduating thence, had spent three years in the study of law. But later on, traits that were particularly his father&#39;s developed. Politics interested him. He told himself he was a born politician, was diplomatic, approachable, had a talent for intrigue, a gift of making friends easily and, most indispensable of all, a veritable genius for putting influential men under obligations to himself. Already he had succeeded in gaining for himself two important offices in the municipal administration of San Francisco--where he had his home--sheriff&#39;s attorney, and, later on, assistant district attorney. But with these small achievements he was by no means satisfied. The largeness of his father&#39;s character, modified in Lyman by a counter-influence of selfishness, had produced in him an inordinate ambition. Where his father during his political career had considered himself only as an exponent of principles he strove to apply, Lyman saw but the office, his own personal aggrandisement. He belonged to the new school, wherein objects were attained not by orations before senates and assemblies, but by sessions of committees, caucuses, compromises and expedients. His goal was to be in fact what Magnus was only in name--governor. Lyman, with shut teeth, had resolved that some day he would sit in the gubernatorial chair in Sacramento. &quot;Lyman is doing well,&quot; answered Magnus. &quot;I could wish he was more pronounced in his convictions, less willing to compromise, but I believe him to be earnest and to have a talent for government and civics. His ambition does him credit, and if he occupied himself a little more with means and a little less with ends, he would, I am sure, be the ideal servant of the people. But I am not afraid. The time will come when the State will be proud of him.&quot; As Harran turned the team into the driveway that led up to Annixter&#39;s house, Magnus remarked: &quot;Harran, isn&#39;t that young Annixter himself on the porch wherefore do our fates tend in such opposite directions &rdquo; ejaculated Wagner. &ldquo;Yes, signor; a crime&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The officer was interrupted by an ejaculation of surprise which burst from the lips of his attendant sbirro; and, turning hastily round, he beheld his follower intently scrutinizing the attire which Fernand had ere now thrown off. &ldquo;Ah &quot; CHAPTER XXIX LOADING FOR HOME--A SURPRISE--LAST OF AN OLD FRIEND--THE LAST HIDE--A HARD CASE--UP ANCHOR, FOR HOME nay, you know that the  Germans themselves are our servants. Have you stronger walls than we have how can it be done &rdquo; cried the nobleman; &ldquo;I have seen so much duplicity where all appeared to be innocence&mdash;so much deceit where all wore the aspect of integrity, that I can trust man no more. How know I for certain that all this may not be some idle tale which you yourself have forged, to induce me to put confidence in you, to intrust you with gold to bribe your pretended informant, but which will really remain in your own pocket It is impossible for thee to return to Florence:&mdash;it is equally impossible for me to renounce the first opportunity which Heaven may afford for me to repair thither &rdquo; and she pointed to a low ottoman within a few paces of the sofa which she herself occupied. Alessandro now recovered his presence of mind; and no longer embarrassed and awkward, but with graceful ease and yet profound respect, he took the seat indicated. &ldquo;Beauteous lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how can I ever demonstrate the gratitude&mdash;the illimitable, boundless gratitude which fills my heart, for the joy, the truly elysian delight afforded me by this meeting Well, I am glad you have gone back to it. It is your natural vehicle.&quot; &quot;You remember the poem &quot; in the same tones, and with the same orders following them, seemed to bring us directly back to our old position of the week before. During our watch on deck, which was from twelve to four, the wind came out ahead, with a pelting storm of hail and sleet, and we lay hove-to, under a close-reefed main topsail, the whole watch. During the next watch it fell calm, with a drenching rain, until daybreak, when the wind came out to the westward, and the weather cleared up, and showed us the whole ocean, in the course which we should have steered, had it not been for the head wind and calm, completely blocked up with ice. Here then our progress was stopped, and we wore ship, and once more stood to the northward and eastward; not for the straits of Magellan, but to make another attempt to double the Cape, still farther to the eastward; for the captain was determined to get round if perseverance could do it; and the third time, he said, never failed. With a fair wind we soon ran clear of the field-ice, and by noon had only the stray islands floating far and near upon the ocean. The sun was out bright, the sea of a deep blue, fringed with the white foam of the waves which ran high before a strong south-wester; our solitary ship tore on through the water, as though glad to be out of her confinement; and the ice islands lay scattered upon the ocean here and there, of various sizes and shapes, reflecting the bright rays of the sun, and drifting slowly northward before the gale. It was a contrast to much that we had lately seen, and a spectacle not only of beauty, but of life; for it required but little fancy to imagine these islands to be animate masses which had broken loose from the &quot;thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice,&quot; and were working their way, by wind and current, some alone, and some in fleets, to milder climes. No pencil has ever yet given anything like the true effect of an iceberg. In a picture, they are huge, uncouth masses, stuck in the sea, while their chief beauty and grandeur,--their slow, stately motion; the whirling of the snow about their summits, and the fearful groaning and cracking of their parts,--the picture cannot give. This is the large iceberg; while the small and distant islands, floating on the smooth sea, in the light of a clear day, look like little floating fairy isles of sapphire. From a north-east course we gradually hauled to the eastward, and after sailing about two hundred miles, which brought us as near to the western coast of Terra del Fuego as was safe, and having lost sight of the ice altogether,--for the third time we put the ship&#39;s head to the southward, to try the passage of the Cape. The weather continued clear and cold, with a strong gale from the westward, and we were fast getting up with the latitude of the Cape, with a prospect of soon being round. One fine afternoon, a man who had gone into the fore-top to shift the rolling tackles, sung out, at the top of his voice, and with evident glee,--&quot;Sail ho What course can I adopt Genslinger could do his worst. He, Magnus, would brave it out. Was not his character above suspicion If you do not love another, can you love me &quot; &quot;I think that&#39;s a crazy-looking monkey-wrench you&#39;ve got there,&quot; observed Annixter, glancing at the instrument in Hooven&#39;s hand. &quot;Ach, dot wrainch,&quot; returned Hooven. &quot;Soh Are they in possession of our letters ) quam una in re, turbulenti ac seditiosi homines et totius reliquae vitae consiliis et rationibus discordes, inhumani foederis stupenda societate convenirent, in pontes et moenia atque immeritos lapides desaevirent. Denique post vi vel senio collapsa palatia, quae quondam ingentes tenuerunt viri, post diruptos arcus triumphales, (unde majores horum forsitan corruerunt,) de ipsius vetustatis ac propriae impietatis fragminibus vilem quaestum turpi mercimonio captare non puduit. Itaque nunc, heu dolor She could not bear up against the bewilderment and alarm produced by these questions which she asked herself, and none of which she could solve. An oppressive sensation came over her; and she was about to sink back upon the couch from which she had risen, when the hymn suddenly ceased&mdash;the nuns rose from their suppliant posture&mdash;and the foremost, addressing the poor girl in a reproachful tone, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh &rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas I who murdered the girl Agnes, in the garden of thy mansion at Florence &quot; demanded Annixter abruptly. &quot;You and he were pretty good friends, were you what misery is in store for us both For why fire Wilt thou refuse to be introduced to a familiar converse with Homer, Plato, and Demosthenes; with those poets, philosophers, and orators, of whom such wonders are related, and who are celebrated by every age as the great masters of human science they will trample thee under their feet.&quot; In his replies, Bajazet poured forth the indignation of a soul which was deeply stung by such unusual contempt. After retorting the basest reproaches on the thief and rebel of the desert, the Ottoman recapitulates his boasted victories in Iran, Touran, and the Indies; and labors to prove, that Timour had never triumphed unless by his own perfidy and the vices of his foes. &quot;Thy armies are innumerable: be they so; but what are the arrows of the flying Tartar against the cimeters and battle-axes of my firm and invincible Janizaries My God and must I be blamed, if knowing&mdash;ah is it possible that thou art no more, my poor Agnes &mdash;oh &quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Annixter got up, cast away his cigar, and dropping the buckskin&#39;s bridle, came and stood beside her, putting a hand on her shoulder. Hilma did not move, and he felt her trembling. She still plucked at the knot of the handkerchief. &quot;I can&#39;t do without you, little girl,&quot; Annixter continued, &quot;and I want you. I want you bad. I don&#39;t get much fun out of life ever. It, sure, isn&#39;t my nature, I guess. I&#39;m a hard man. Everybody is trying to down me, and now I&#39;m up against the Railroad. I&#39;m fighting &#39;em all, Hilma, night and day, lock, stock, and barrel, and I&#39;m fighting now for my home, my land, everything I have in the world. If I win out, I want somebody to be glad with me. If I don&#39;t--I want somebody to be sorry for me, sorry with me,--and that somebody is you. I am dog-tired of going it alone. I want some one to back me up. I want to feel you alongside of me, to give me a touch of the shoulder now and then. I&#39;m tired of fighting for THINGS--land, property, money. I want to fight for some PERSON--somebody beside myself. Understand</p>
