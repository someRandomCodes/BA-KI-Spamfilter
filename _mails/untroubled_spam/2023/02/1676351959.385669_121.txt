						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What is a vehicle tracker?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quite simply, it&rsquo;s a small electronic box that fits inside your vehicle, which sends signals with details of where it is and what speed it is travelling at.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This super useful data comes from the GPS Satellite system, which also feeds position data on your vehicles to all your satnavs and devices.</span></p>





						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>In a word? Data. </i>These <a href="http://www.libertyportion.shop/nxnhkpbarr/skgqri6971jxcurpg/PM2ZdCq1C1xcd_za6wwJ6cM2uEbdIURGWxRah5SCMv8/2jYbfgxDQ7ufDu_7bzP9RmnqGBDVq6Xir-BXFAanGoc">modern tracking systems</a> give you and your company huge amounts of powerful data that will let you run your fleet more efficiently &ndash; which means <i>saving a lot of money</i>.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Most importantly, you can also <a href="http://www.libertyportion.shop/nxnhkpbarr/skgqri6971jxcurpg/PM2ZdCq1C1xcd_za6wwJ6cM2uEbdIURGWxRah5SCMv8/2jYbfgxDQ7ufDu_7bzP9RmnqGBDVq6Xir-BXFAanGoc">monitor driver behaviour data</a>, such as harsh acceleration and braking, time using the cruise control, pedal position, rpm bands, fuel consumption, and engine diagnostics. This nifty little device will stop your workers driving like maniacs in a flash!</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">And all of this rich telematics information is then fed back to you, directly on your PC or smart phone.</span></p>

<p><b style="font: 4px Gisha; color: #800080;">David proudly graduated from high school top of his class at age 97.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.Sometimes it is better to just walk away from things and go back to them later when you&rsquo;re in a better frame of mind.He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.I honestly find her about as intimidating as a basket of kittens.8 of 25 is the same as 25 of 8 and one of them is much easier to do in your head.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.She saw the brake lights, but not in time.Random words in front of other random words create a random sentence.Traveling became almost extinct during the pandemic.It took me too long to realize that the ceiling hadn&#39;t been painted to look like the sky.He walked into the basement with the horror movie from the night before playing in his head.There are few things better in than a slice of pie.They wandered into a strange Tiki bar on the edge of the small beach town.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.She couldn&#39;t understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.He ran out of , so he had to playing poker.I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.Best friends are like old tomatoes and shoelaces.I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but - I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.It&#39;s been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.Some bathing suits just shouldn&rsquo;t be worn by some people.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain of her strangeness.He shaved the peach to prove a point.Green should have smelled more tranquil, but somehow it just tasted rotten.</b></p>
