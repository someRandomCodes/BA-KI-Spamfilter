she decked herself with the flowers which she had gathered early in the mor=

salt water, pure from the ocean, and the fresh was used only to start the a=
ccumulated grime and blackness of five weeks, it was held of little consequ=

 innocents. The iron monster had charged full into the midst, merciless, in=
exorable. To the right and left, all the width of the right of way, the lit=

ns knocked out. Caught in the barbs of the wire, wedged in, the bodies hung=
 suspended. Under foot it was terrible. The black blood, winking in the sta=

to add, &quot;but I can tell you beforehand that you may expect only a refu=

ting smoke, jumped from his knee to the floor and picking her way across th=

 privation of which she dared not think; and, besides, the forbidding look =
of the building frightened her. It was dark, gloomy, dirty, a place suggest=

r, she hesitated, walking twice and three times around the block. At last, =
she made up her mind. Exhaustion such as she had never known, weighed like =
lead upon her shoulders and dragged at her heels. She must sleep. She could=
 not walk the streets all night. She entered the door pitched growl rising =
continually into the hot, still air. Then, at length, about twelve o&#39;cl=

the Opera House. Presley, who had left his pony at the City livery stable, =
found himself caught in the current and carried slowly forward in its direc=

as dirty as a pigsty. Five minutes in the forecastle was enough for us, and=
