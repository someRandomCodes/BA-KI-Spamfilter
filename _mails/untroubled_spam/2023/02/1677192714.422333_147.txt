						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What is a vehicle tracker?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quite simply, it&rsquo;s a small electronic box that fits inside your vehicle, which sends signals with details of where it is and what speed it is travelling at.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This super useful data comes from the GPS Satellite system, which also feeds position data on your vehicles to all your satnavs and devices.</span></p>





						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>In a word? Data. </i>These <a href="http://www.freightecstasy.shop/pfoswnu/pluqo7653mdtwvgo/xqDcx6xuwdHQ7AGXjtqW0JXY3WIn215ek-fmH0_opOo/HibF_Yjmuws0b0pA1UkEFD5xALdXyR0SVyWKsFd9U-I">modern tracking systems</a> give you and your company huge amounts of powerful data that will let you run your fleet more efficiently &ndash; which means <i>saving a lot of money</i>.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Most importantly, you can also <a href="http://www.freightecstasy.shop/pfoswnu/pluqo7653mdtwvgo/xqDcx6xuwdHQ7AGXjtqW0JXY3WIn215ek-fmH0_opOo/HibF_Yjmuws0b0pA1UkEFD5xALdXyR0SVyWKsFd9U-I">monitor driver behaviour data</a>, such as harsh acceleration and braking, time using the cruise control, pedal position, rpm bands, fuel consumption, and engine diagnostics. This nifty little device will stop your workers driving like maniacs in a flash!</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">And all of this rich telematics information is then fed back to you, directly on your PC or smart phone.</span></p>

<div id="output">&rdquo; exclaimed Francisco, starting back in surprise not unmingled with anger; &ldquo;you were there, Flora&mdash;and you knew that I was in despair concerning thee&mdash;that I would have given worlds to have heard of thy safety,&mdash;I, who thought that some fiend in human shape had sent thee to an early grave THAT&#39;S a pretty good one &quot; &quot;References But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Nisida had in the meantime drawn from her bosom one of the slips of paper before alluded to; and, handing it to the bandit-chief, she made a hasty and imperious motion for him to read it. He obeyed her with the mechanical submission produced by astonishment and curiosity, mingled with admiration for that bold and daring woman, whom he already loved and resolved to win: but his surprise was increased a hundred-fold, when he perused these lines:&mdash;&ldquo;I am the Lady Nisida of Riverola. Your design is known to me; it matters not how. Rumor has doubtless told you that I am deaf and dumb; hence this mode of communicating with you. You have been deluded by an idle knave&mdash;for there is no treasure in the closet yonder. Even if there had been, I should have removed it the moment your intended predatory visit was made known to me. But you can serve me; and I will reward you well for your present disappointment.&rdquo; &ldquo;What does the paper say Why, I couldn&#39;t be happy, with all the money in the world, if I thought that even one little child hated me--hated me so that it would spit and hiss at me. And it&#39;s not one child, it&#39;s all of them, so Sidney says; and think of all the grown people who hate the road, women and men, the whole county, the whole State, thousands and thousands of people. Don&#39;t the managers and the directors of the road ever think of that &rdquo; interrupted the countess, raising Flora from her suppliant position on the cold pavement of the cell, and embracing her. &ldquo;No, if those on whom I rely fulfill the hope that we have entertained we shall go forth together. And, oh &quot; is bawled from aloft. &quot;Overhaul your clew-lines some treachery has doubtless been practiced toward thee you know what countryman &#39;e carpenter be while upon those souls that wear away in and with their distempered bodies comes a subterranean night to dissolve them to nothing, and a deep oblivion to take away all the remembrance of them, and this notwithstanding they be clean from all spots and defilements of this world; so that, in this ease, the soul at the same time comes to the utmost bounds of its life, and of its body, and of its memorial also. But since he hath determined that death is to come of necessity upon all men, a sword is a better instrument for that purpose than any disease whatsoever. Why is it not then a very mean thing for us not to yield up that to the public benefit which we must yield up to fate &rdquo; said the bandit. &ldquo;And yet methought I was a stranger to you, although you were none to me at the casino.&rdquo; &ldquo;You were a stranger until now,&rdquo; continued Orsini; &ldquo;but Isaachar knew by the knock which you dealt so lustily on his door, who was his visitor.&rdquo; &ldquo;And your lordship was desirous to see me &rdquo; &ldquo;Agnes&mdash;Agnes &quot; &quot;Anything wrong &rdquo; asked Francisco. &ldquo;Alas and will not such things sharpen your souls to revenge &ldquo;Back&mdash;back with the murderer to his dungeon &rdquo; said Wagner, pointing toward the mansion which, as we stated at the commencement of that chapter, was situated at a distance of about two hundred yards from Fernand&rsquo;s dwelling, the backs of the two houses thus looking toward each other. &ldquo;Those lights,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;are shining in a mansion the gardens of which are separated from my own by a simple hedge of evergreens, that would not bar even the passage of a child. Should any inmate of that mansion possess curiosity sufficient to induce him or her to cross the boundary, traverse my gardens, and approach the casements of my residence, that curiosity may be easily gratified.&rdquo; &ldquo;And to whom does yon mansion belong wherefore did you accompany the old man to the altar, if only to deceive him Not a human being but ourselves for miles; and no sound heard but the pulsations of the great Pacific Deaf and dumb must I appear&mdash;deaf and dumb must I yet be deemed for a short space. But to-night, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, you will meet me, Demetrius, in the garden of the Riverola mansion;&mdash;and then I will conduct you to an apartment where we may confer without fear of being overheard&mdash;without danger of interruption.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not fail thee, lady,&rdquo; said the Greek, scarcely able to recover from the amazement into which Nisida&rsquo;s sudden revelation of her power of speech and hearing had thrown him: then, as an oppressive feeling seized upon his soul, he demanded, &ldquo;But Calanthe, lady, in the name of heaven But wearisome&mdash;oh Look at it all from the vast height of humanity--&#39;the greatest good to the greatest numbers.&#39; What remains Will you try the place &mdash;would ramble hand-in-hand, along the stream&rsquo;s enchanting banks, in the calm hours of moonlight, which lent softer charms to the scene than when the gorgeous sun was bathed all in gold. Or else they would wander on the sands to the musical murmur of the rippling sea,&mdash;their arms clasping each other&rsquo;s neck&mdash;their eyes exchanging glances of fondness&mdash;hers of ardent passion, his of more melting tenderness. But there was too much sensuality in the disposition of Nisida to render her love for Wagner sufficient and powerful enough to insure permanent contentment with her present lot. The first time that the fatal eve drew near when he must exchange the shape of man for that of a horrid wolf, he had said to her, &ldquo;Beloved Nisida, I remember that there are finer and different fruits on the other side of the island, beyond the range of mountains; and I should rejoice to obtain for thee a variety. Console thyself for a few hours during mine absence; and on my return we shall experience renewed and increased happiness, as if we were meeting again after a long separation.&rdquo; Vainly did Nisida assure him that she reckoned not for a more extensive variety of fruits than those which the nearest grove yielded, and that she would rather have his society than all the luxuries which his absence and return might bring; he overruled her remonstrances&mdash;and she at length permitted him to depart. Then he crossed the mountains by means of the path which he had described when he escaped from the torrent at the point where the tree stretched across the stream, as described in the preceding chapter; and on the other side of the range of hills he fulfilled the dreadful destiny of the Wehr-Wolf where were those fearless freebooters who six days previously had sailed from Leghorn on their piratical voyage &rdquo; cried Agnes, now surveying the young count with interest and curiosity. &ldquo;Oh &rdquo; said the lieutenant, who had approached the window, from which he was looking. Wagner sprung from his couch, and glanced forth into the garden beneath. The sbirri were advancing along the gravel pathway, bearing amongst them the corpse of Agnes upon whose pallid countenance the morning sunbeams were dancing, as if in mockery even at death. &ldquo;Holy Virgin &rsquo; &lsquo;They are no doubt already in the neighborhood,&rsquo; replied Antonio, &lsquo;and will pounce upon their victims as soon as young Francisco leaves the place. Another set of officers are after the Marquis of Orsini.&rsquo; The two miscreants then departed, continuing their conversation in a low tone as they went along the street, but I overheard no more.&rdquo; &ldquo;The wretches How soon hast thou forgotten thyself &quot; He stretched three or four times, twisting about in his place, curling and uncurling his toes, muttering from time to time between two yawns: &quot;Oh, Lord &quot; &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll come over.&quot; &quot;You&#39;ll have to turn &#39;railroad,&#39; understand &quot; asked the mate.--&quot;Let go the topsail halyards, fore and aft He would, and behold On reaching the door of the chamber, Francisco knocked gently; and the glance of intelligence which passed between himself and Flora showed that each was a prey to the same breathless suspense; the same mingled feelings of bright hopes and vague fears. In a few moments the door was slowly opened; and the venerable old man appeared, his countenance wearing a solemn and mournful aspect. Then Francisco and the young countess knew that all was over; and tears started into their eyes. Christian Rosencrux beckoned them to advance toward the bed, around which the curtains were drawn closer; and as they entered the room, the rapid and simultaneous glances which they cast toward the spot where Fernand Wagner fell down and surrendered up his breath, showed them that the corpse had been removed. Approaching the bed with slow and measured steps, Rosencrux drew aside the drapery; and for a moment Francisco and Flora shrank back from the spectacle which met their view; but at the next instant they advanced to the couch, and contemplated with mournful attention the scene presented to them. For there&mdash;upon that couch&mdash;side by side, lay Fernand Wagner and Nisida of Riverola&mdash;stiff, motionless, cold. &ldquo;Grieve not for her loss, children,&rdquo; said Christian Rosencrux; &ldquo;she has gone to a happier realm&mdash;for the sincere repentance which she manifested in her last hours has atoned for all the evil she wrought in her lifetime. From the moment, young lady, when she banished from her soul the rancor long harbored there against thee&mdash;from the instant that she received thee in her arms, and called thee sister&mdash;the blessing of Heaven was vouchsafed unto her. She was penitent, very penitent, while I administered to her the consolations of religion, and a complete change came over her mind. Grieve not, then, for her; happy on earth she never could have been again&mdash;but happy in heaven she doubtless now is &quot; Instantly there was a confusion on board which no one could account for who has not been in the same situation. All discipline seemed for a moment relaxed. &quot;What&#39;s that, Mr. Brown may the good angels grant that I may yet recover my beloved sister Nisida, and that sweetest of maidens&mdash;Flora Francatelli How long before you&#39;ll settle up accounts with six inches of plugged gas-pipe &rdquo; ejaculated the abbess. &ldquo;Oh How long at length will you abuse our patience But,&rdquo; she exclaimed, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, and as a reminiscence appeared suddenly to strike her, &ldquo;dost thou not think that even such a destiny as that becomes tolerable, when it is fulfilled as the only means of carrying out the conditions of a vow breathed to a well-beloved and dying mother &rdquo; &ldquo;And those hopes shall not be disappointed, dearest Calanthe Who would undertake to feed such an enormous multitude how well can I comprehend it now; for I also shall soon become a mother. Yes, Fernand He had had no thought of fame while composing &quot;The Toilers.&quot; He had only been moved to his heart&#39;s foundations,--thoroughly in earnest, seeing clearly,--and had addressed himself to the poem&#39;s composition in a happy moment when words came easily to him, and the elaboration of fine sentences was not difficult. Was it thus fame was achieved A village is gained; he turns not aside, but dashes madly through the little street formed by the huts and cottages of the Tuscan vine-dressers. A little child is in his path&mdash;a sweet, blooming, ruddy, noble boy; with violet-colored eyes and flaxen hair&mdash;disporting merrily at a short distance from his parents, who are seated at the threshold of their dwelling. Suddenly a strange and ominous rush&mdash;an unknown trampling of rapid feet falls upon their ears; then, with a savage cry, a monster sweeps past. &ldquo;My child with such whirlwind speed along. But that Wehr-Wolf bears a charmed life; for though the hounds overtake him&mdash;fall upon him&mdash;and attack him with all the courage of their nature, yet does he hurl them from him, toss them aside, spurn them away, and at length free himself from their pursuit altogether &rdquo; interrupted the robber chief. &ldquo;The few crowns you speak of, were neither more nor less than a tribute paid on consideration that my men should leave unscathed the dwelling of worthy Isaachar ben Solomon: in other words, that thy treasures should be safe at least from them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well&mdash;well</div>
