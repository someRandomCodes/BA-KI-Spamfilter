<p>To think that another may possess her, clasp her in his arms, press his lips to hers, feel her fragrant breath fan his cheek, play with the rich tresses of her beauteous hair, oh &rdquo; exclaimed the grand vizier; and throwing himself upon the floor, he buried his face in his hands. In another moment Calanthe was seized and gagged, before even a word or a scream could escape her lips; but Ibrahim heard the rustling of her dress as she unavailingly struggled with the monsters in whose power she was. The selfish ingrate My father see Captain Cook within the last week I have received the conviction that a being bearing thine image will see the light in due time; and the honor of the proud name of Riverola requires that our child must not be born of an unwedded mother Starting up, he again paced the dungeon in an agitated manner. &ldquo;Holy God &rdquo; exclaimed Francisco; &ldquo;and are we indeed thus blest, or is it a delusive dream &rdquo; said Stephano. &ldquo;Most assuredly &quot; &quot;What&#39;s up, anyways &quot;--HEADING FOR HOME In our first attempt to double the Cape, when we came up to the latitude of it, we were nearly seventeen hundred miles to the westward, but, in running for the straits of Magellan, we stood so far to the eastward, that we made our second attempt at a distance of not more than four or five hundred miles; and we had great hopes, by this means, to run clear of the ice; thinking that the easterly gales, which had prevailed for a long time, would have driven it to the westward. With the wind about two points free, the yards braced in a little, and two close-reefed topsails and a reefed foresail on the ship, we made great way toward the southward and, almost every watch, when we came on deck, the air seemed to grow colder, and the sea to run higher. Still, we saw no ice, and had great hopes of going clear of it altogether, when, one afternoon, about three o&#39;clock, while we were taking a siesta during our watch below, &quot;All hands &rdquo; asked Ibrahim. &ldquo;Happy in being permitted to attend upon your highness,&rdquo; was the reply, delivered in a soft and tremulous tone. &ldquo;But is it in my power to render you happier There only seems to be one horse.&quot; &quot;Too much dust for one horse.&quot; Annixter, who had taken his field glasses from Harran, adjusted them to his eyes. &quot;That&#39;s not them,&quot; he announced presently, &quot;nor Hooven either. That&#39;s a cart.&quot; Then after another moment, he added, &quot;The butcher&#39;s cart from Guadalajara.&quot; The tension was relaxed. The men drew long breaths, settling back in their places. &quot;Do we let him go on, Governor what wouldst thou with me &quot; &quot;Captain gone ashore His Nisida was restored to him, and no longer Nisida the deaf and dumb, but Nisida who could hear the fond language which he addressed to her, and who could respond in the sweetest, most melting and delicious tones that ever came from woman&rsquo;s lips. For a long time their hearts were too full, alike for total silence or connected conversation, and while the world from which they were cut off was entirely forgotten, they gathered so much happiness from the few words in which they indulged, and from all that they read in each other&rsquo;s eyes, that the emotions which they experienced might have furnished sensations for a lifetime. At length&mdash;she scarcely knew how the subject began, although it might naturally have arisen of its own spontaneous suggestion&mdash;Nisida found herself speaking of the long period of deception which she had maintained in relation to her powers of speech and hearing. &ldquo;Thou lovest me well, dearest Fernand,&rdquo; she said in her musical Italian tones; &ldquo;and thou would&rsquo;st not create a pang in my heart what sounds are those was not this invasion of the sacred place undertaken to rescue that guilty woman And you are sorry and you WILL be good to me if I will be your wife But mine was a will of iron strength&mdash;a resolution of indomitable power &quot; &quot;Wail, I tell you dose ting, Meest&#39;r Ennixter. Alle-ways, I tink a lot oaf Shairmany, und der Kaiser, und nef&#39;r I forgedt Gravelotte. Budt, say, I tell you dose ting. Vhair der wife is, und der kinder--der leedle girl Hilda--DERE IS DER VATERLAND. Eh &quot; shouted the captain, in answer, at the top of his voice. Down came the topsail yards, the reef-tackles were manned and hauled out, and we climbed up to windward, and sprang into the weather rigging. The violence of the wind, and the hail and sleet, driving nearly horizontally across the ocean, seemed actually to pin us down to the rigging. It was hard work making head against them. One after another, we got out upon the yards. And here we had work to do; for our new sails, which had hardly been bent long enough to get the starch out of them, were as stiff as boards, and the new earings and reef-points, stiffened with the sleet, knotted like pieces of iron wire. Having only our round jackets and straw hats on, we were soon wet through, and it was every moment growing colder. Our hands were soon stiffened and numbed, which, added to the stiffness of everything else, kept us a good while on the yard. After we had got the sail hauled upon the yard, we had to wait a long time for the weather earing to be passed; but there was no fault to be found, for French John was at the earing, and a better sailor never laid out on a yard; so we leaned over the yard, and beat our hands upon the sail to keep them from freezing. At length the word came--&quot;Haul out to leeward,&quot;--and we seized the reef-points and hauled the band taught for the lee earing. &quot;Taught band--Knot away,&quot; and we got the first reef fast, and were just going to lay down, when--&quot;Two reefs--two reefs Had there even been any bed last night Our hearts were all up in our mouths, and we pulled away like good fellows; for the precious packet could not be opened except by the captain. As we pulled under the stern, the clerk held up the package, and called out to the mate, who was leaning over the taffrail, that the California had arrived. &quot;Hurrah my dear&mdash;my well-beloved and never-to-be-forgotten mother she weeps because she has not courage to fly with her lover &rdquo; exclaimed Ibrahim, unable to repress his wrath; then, in a different and milder tone, he immediately added, &ldquo;Slave, I can make thee free&mdash;I can give thee wealth&mdash;and thou mayest dwell in happy Italy, whither we are going, for the remainder of thy days. Reflect, consider She, whom he had been planning to educate like a veritable lady. For all that year he had talked of his ambition for his little daughter to every one he met. All Bonneville knew of it. What a mark for gibes he had made of himself. The workingman turned farmer I ought not to upbraid thee for that watchfulness during my absence, and that joy at my return, which prove that you love me wherefore not conclude the sentence that was half uttered and where was she &rdquo; cried Verrina; &ldquo;all are gone save Nisida and myself &rdquo; &ldquo;No, my lord &quot; Nor did he give ill words to any of those that beat him every day, nor good words to those that gave him food; but this was his reply to all men, and indeed no other than a melancholy presage of what was to come. This cry of his was the loudest at the festivals; and he continued this ditty for seven years and five months, without growing hoarse, or being tired therewith, until the very time that he saw his presage in earnest fulfilled in our siege, when it ceased; for as he was going round upon the wall, he cried out with his utmost force, &quot;Woe, woe to the city again, and to the people, and to the holy house &rdquo; cried Francisco, the tears starting into his eyes. &ldquo;For, alas &quot; started us out of our berths; and, it not being very cold weather, we had nothing extra to put on, and were soon on deck. I shall never forget the fineness of the sight. It was a clear, and rather a chilly night; the stars were twinkling with an intense brightness, and as far as the eye could reach, there was not a cloud to be seen. The horizon met the sea in a defined line. A painter could not have painted so clear a sky. There was not a speck upon it. Yet it was blowing great guns from the north-west. When you can see a cloud to windward, you feel that there is a place for the wind to come from; but here it seemed to come from nowhere. No person could have told, from the heavens, by their eyesight alone, that it was not a still summer&#39;s night. One reef after another, we took in the topsails, and before we could get them hoisted up, we heard a sound like a short, quick rattling of thunder, and the jib was blown to atoms out of the bolt-rope. We got the topsails set, and the fragments of the jib stowed away, and the fore-topmast staysail set in its place, when the great mainsail gaped open, and the sail ripped from head to foot. &quot;Lay up on that main-yard and furl the sail, before it blows to tatters Good Lord, I don&#39;t know how to say these fool things. I talk like a galoot when I get talking to feemale girls and I can&#39;t lay my tongue to anything that sounds right. It isn&#39;t my nature. And look here, I lied when I said I liked to have people like me--to be popular. Rot &quot;--WHALES--SAN JUAN--ROMANCE OF HIDE- DROGHING--SAN DIEGO AGAIN The next Sunday was Easter Sunday, and as there had been no liberty at San Pedro, it was our turn to go ashore and misspend another Sabbath. Soon after breakfast, a large boat, filled with men in blue jackets, scarlet caps, and various colored under-clothes, bound ashore on liberty, left the Italian ship, and passed under our stern; the men singing beautiful Italian boat-songs, all the way, in fine, full chorus. Among the songs I recognized the favorite &quot;O Pescator dell&#39; onda.&quot; It brought back to my mind pianofortes, drawing-rooms, young ladies singing, and a thousand other things which as little befitted me, in my situation, to be thinking upon. Supposing that the whole day would be too long a time to spend ashore, as there was no place to which we could take a ride, we remained quietly on board until after dinner. We were then pulled ashore in the stern of the boat, and, with orders to be on the beach at sundown, we took our way for the town. There, everything wore the appearance of a holyday. The people were all dressed in their best; the men riding about on horseback among the houses, and the women sitting on carpets before the doors. Under the piazza of a &quot;pulperia,&quot; two men were seated, decked out with knots of ribbons and bouquets, and playing the violin and the Spanish guitar. These are the only instruments, with the exception of the drums and trumpets at Monterey that I ever heard in California; and I suspect they play upon no others, for at a great fandango at which I was afterwards present, and where they mustered all the music they could find, there were three violins and two guitars, and no other instrument.
