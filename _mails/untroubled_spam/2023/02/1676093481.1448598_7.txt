<p><b style="font: 5px Abadi MT Condensed Light; color: #2554C7;">The sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law&#39;s bed.He is no James Bond; his is Roger Moore.They ran around the corner to find that they had traveled back in time.He learned the important lesson that a picnic at the beach on a windy day is a bad idea.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is a matter of time.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of minerals.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing my piggy on the same day!The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.He kept telling himself that one day it would ll somehow make sense.Barking dogs and screaming toddlers have the unique ability to turn friendly neighbors into cranky enemies.The body piercing didn&#39;t go exactly as he expected.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.We have been to Asia, nor have we visited Africa.I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.He dreamed of leaving his law firm to a portable dog wash.She always had an interesting perspective on why the world must be flat.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should Nair.Acres of almond trees lined the interstate highway which complimented the crazy driving nuts.The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance.They looked up at the sky and saw a millin stars.Tuesdays are fre if you bring a gnome costume.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.In hopes of finding out the truth, he entered the one-room library.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.Thigh-high in the water, the fisherman&rsquo;s hope for dinner turned to despair.</b></p>
