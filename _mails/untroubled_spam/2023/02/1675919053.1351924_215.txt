Spring Branch Hospital, where she remained until she left Houston.[23]Seddon and Gibson with newborn baby Paul Seddon officially became an astronaut in August 1979, after NASA decided that one year of training was sufficient.[24][25] As with earlier astronaut groups, each astronaut candidate was assigned a particular specialization; Seddon's assignment was the Space Shuttle food system and the orbital medical kit.[26] For STS-1, the first orbital spaceflight of NASA's Space Shuttle program and the inaugural flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia, Abbey decided that the five MDs of the 1978 and 1980 astronaut groups – Norman Thagard, Anna Fisher and Seddon from the 1978 group, and Bill Fisher and Jim Bagian from the 1980 group – would be assigned to the search and rescue helicopters supporting the flight. These would be required if the Space Shuttle crashed or the astronauts had to eject.[27] Seddon was placed in charge of the group, and as such could choose her own assignment. She therefore decided to join the group at Cape Canaveral. In the event, the mission went well, and search and rescue was not required.[28] In February 1981 Seddon became engaged to fellow astronaut Robert L. "Hoot" Gibson. They were married on May 30 in a ceremony at the First United Methodist Church in Murfreesboro, followed by a reception at the Stones River Country Club. A second reception was held in Houston, followed by a honeymoon in Hawaii. Seddon (who retained her maiden name) then resumed her role with search and rescue in preparation for the upcoming STS-2 mission. She also worked in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, where the Space Shuttle's software was tested.[29][30] Seddon's first child was born i
