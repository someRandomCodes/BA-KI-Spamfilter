<p><b style="font: 10px Mongolian Baiti; color: #837E7C;">He swore he just saw his sushi move.The key lime pie is still up for debate.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.Abstraction is often one floor above you.The teenage boy was accused of breaking his arm simply to out of the test.Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.Traveling became almost extinct during the pandemic.The Tsunami wave crashed against the raised houses and broke the pilings as if they were toothpicks.No matter how beautiful the sunset, it saddened her knowing she was one day older.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.Nothing is as cautiously cuddly as a pet porcupine.They ran around the corner to find that they had traveled back in time.He was sure the Devil created red sparkly glitter.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.Don&#39;t piss in my garden and tell me you&#39;re trying to help my plants grow.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.A quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should Nair.I covered my in baby oil.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?The dead trees waited to be ignited by the smallest spark and seek their revenge.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his .Gary didn&#39;t understand why Doug went upstairs to one dollar bills when he invited him to go cow tipping.The bird had a belief that it was really a groundhog.Not people who wander are lost.</b></p>
