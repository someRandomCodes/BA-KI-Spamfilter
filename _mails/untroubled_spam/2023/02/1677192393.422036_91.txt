<h2>Hi, this is Dr. Theo Diktaban. As a surgeon, I simply can&#39;t afford to be tired all the time.<br />


It could cost someone their life.</h2>





<h2>And it was for exactly that reason I put my medical training to good use by<br />


researching the causes of fatigue, and more importantly, how to fix it.</h2>





<h2>What did I find?&nbsp;</h2>





<h2>Well, the first thing to know is that constantly feeling tired is a serious warning<br />


signs of all the health issues you don&#39;t want to deal with:</h2>





<h2><strong><u><a href="http://www.kitchenoutlook.shop/nqfesonc/wawvp7598fvlkcn/tJGp3UFGXLB-VuSkxF00MYFlcfxSxfkMIdUauG7ymYU/5BK6yA83SggTztXXKb4DwHxz15k1aKFpGJqh_rJLdpg" target="_blank">Heart Disease, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Brain problems and more...</a></u></strong></h2>





<h2>Second, my research led me to several delicious foods you can eat every day<br />


that instantly skyrocket your energy levels - and keep them up all day, without<br />


any type of jitters or crash.</h2>





<h2>I made a brief video about it that reveals not only these every day foods, but<br />


three &quot;health foods&quot; you need to AVOID at all costs.&nbsp;</h2>





<h2>Sure, you&#39;re told by the Big Food corporations and their fancy marketing&nbsp;<br />


departments they&#39;re good for you, but in reality, they&#39;re doing nothing but<br />


zapping your energy, lowering your metabolism and destroying your health.&nbsp;</h2>





<h2>If you want to fix your fatigue - and avoid the serious health problems associated&nbsp;<br />


with it - simply <strong><u><a href="http://www.kitchenoutlook.shop/nqfesonc/wawvp7598fvlkcn/tJGp3UFGXLB-VuSkxF00MYFlcfxSxfkMIdUauG7ymYU/5BK6yA83SggTztXXKb4DwHxz15k1aKFpGJqh_rJLdpg" target="_blank">take my advice and eat THIS daily.&nbsp;</a></u></strong></h2>

<div id="output">&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;And I, too,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;have been very miserable since we last met.&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Then you have thought of me Oh, Magnus, I don&#39;t know what has come over you these last few weeks. Why, before this, you would have been insulted if any one thought you would even consider anything like dishonesty. Magnus, it would break my heart if you joined Mr. Annixter and Mr. Osterman. Why, you couldn&#39;t be the same man to me afterward; you, who have kept yourself so clean till now. And the boys; what would Lyman say, and Harran, and every one who knows you and respects you, if you lowered yourself to be just a political adventurer How much sorrow&mdash;how much misery should I have been spared &quot; he asked. Promptly the passengers surrounded him, voluble with questions. But he was in a bad temper. &quot;I don&#39;t know anything more than you,&quot; he shouted angrily. &quot;It was a hold-up. I guess you know that, don&#39;t you And in business ways, too,&quot; he went on, speaking half to himself, &quot;in Bonneville and all over the county there&#39;s not a man of them wouldn&#39;t howl for joy if they got a chance to down Buck Annixter. Think I care &rsquo; &lsquo;They are no doubt already in the neighborhood,&rsquo; replied Antonio, &lsquo;and will pounce upon their victims as soon as young Francisco leaves the place. Another set of officers are after the Marquis of Orsini.&rsquo; The two miscreants then departed, continuing their conversation in a low tone as they went along the street, but I overheard no more.&rdquo; &ldquo;The wretches &rdquo; cried the marquis, impatiently; for his heart began to grow sick with the fear of disappointment in respect to his plan of obtaining the diamonds of his mistress. &ldquo;And Stephano Verrina took them from me&mdash;basely, vilely, wrenched them as it were from my grasp &rdquo; murmured the marquis falling back in his bed, a prey to the most torturing feelings; and then his lips framed the sweet and tender name of &ldquo; Giulia Stretched upon the stone floor of the narrow cell lay the victim&mdash;motionless and still &rdquo; And the old lord&rsquo;s tone changed suddenly from the deep, touching pathos of tremulousness to a stern, fixed, cold severity, which stifled the germs of hope that had taken birth in the heart of his guilty wife. &ldquo;Mercy &rdquo; exclaimed the countess, looking up in a searching manner at the robber-chief; for she had seated herself at the table to write, and he was leaning over the back of her chair. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my way at times,&rdquo; he answered, carelessly, &ldquo;when I perform some service for a noble lord or a great lady, to solicit an acknowledgment of this kind in preference to gold.&rdquo; Then, sinking his voice to a low whisper, he added with an air of deep meaning, &ldquo;Who knows but that this document may some day save my head &quot; But he evidently enjoyed the joke. The pig squealed like the &quot;crack of doom,&quot; and tears stood in the poor darky&#39;s eyes; and he muttered something about having no pity on a dumb beast. &quot;Dumb beast &mdash;I mean the guilty, fallen creature who once bore my name Did all of them go, all three &rdquo; &ldquo;Holy Virgin &quot; cried Hilma, laying her hand upon young Vacca&#39;s arm. &quot;Stop the horses. Listen, what was that &quot; &quot;Good morning, Pres, my boy.&quot; The Governor came forward and, putting his hand on the pony&#39;s withers, walked along by his side. &quot;Going to town, Pres And as the person to whom he found himself thus indebted was a stranger&mdash;a total stranger to him, he had no apology to offer for a delay in the payment of the money due. &ldquo;Perdition &quot; Ruggles spread out his hands with a deprecatory gesture. &quot;I don&#39;t own the &#39;Mercury,&#39;&quot; he said. &quot;Well, your company does.&quot; &quot;If it does, I don&#39;t know anything about it.&quot; &quot;Oh, rot &rdquo; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;we have met before, count,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Dost thou not remember Fernand Wagner &rdquo; &ldquo;The murderer was arrested immediately after the perpetration of the crime,&rdquo; responded Ursula; &ldquo;and at this moment he is a prisoner in the dungeon of the palace.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is the lost man that has perpetrated such a dreadful crime O Agnes&mdash;my darling That would be acknowledging the railroad&#39;s ownership right away--forfeiting their rights for good. None of the LEAGUERS are doing it, I know. That would be the rankest treachery.&quot; He paused for a moment, drinking the rest of the mineral water, then interrupting Lyman, who was about to speak to Presley, drawing him into the conversation through politeness, said: &quot;Matters are just romping right along to a crisis these days. It&#39;s a make or break for the wheat growers of the State now, no mistake. Here are the land cases and the new grain tariff drawing to a head at about the same time. If we win our land cases, there&#39;s your new freight rates to be applied, and then all is beer and skittles. Won&#39;t the San Joaquin go wild if we pull it off, and I believe we will.&quot; &quot;How we wheat growers are exploited and trapped and deceived at every turn,&quot; observed Magnus sadly. &quot;The courts, the capitalists, the railroads, each of them in turn hoodwinks us into some new and wonderful scheme, only to betray us in the end. Well,&quot; he added, turning to Lyman, &quot;one thing at least we can depend on. We will cut their grain rates for them, eh, Lyman For they foretold that this city should be then taken when somebody shall begin the slaughter of his own countrymen. And are not both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen &quot; &quot;Yes, two cents a pound--that&#39;s in car-load lots, of course. I won&#39;t give you that rate on smaller consignments.&quot; &quot;Yes, car-load lots, of course . . . two cents. Well, all right.&quot; He turned away with a great sigh of relief. &quot;He sure did have me scared for a minute,&quot; he said to Annixter, as the two went down to the street, &quot;fiddling and fussing so long. Two cents is all right, though. Seems fair to me. That fiddling of his was all put on. I know &#39;em, these railroad heelers. He knew I was a discharged employee first off, and he played the game just to make me seem small because I had to ask favours of him. I don&#39;t suppose the General Office tips its slavees off to act like swine, but there&#39;s the feeling through the whole herd of them. &#39;Ye got to come to us. We let ye live only so long as we choose, and what are ye going to do about it Raising the window curtain, he made a shade with both hands on either side of his face and looked out. The night was thick, dark, clouded over. A fine rain was falling, leaving horizontal streaks on the glass of the outside window. Only the faintest grey blur indicated the sky. Everything else was impenetrable blackness. &quot;I think sure we must have passed Fresno,&quot; he muttered. He looked at his watch. It was about half-past three. &quot;If we have passed Fresno,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I&#39;d better wake the little girl pretty soon. She&#39;ll need about an hour to dress. Better find out for sure.&quot; He drew on his trousers and shoes, got into his coat, and stepped out into the aisle. In the seat that had been occupied by the porter, the Pullman conductor, his cash box and car-schedules before him, was checking up his berths, a blue pencil behind his ear. &quot;What&#39;s the next stop, Captain &rdquo; demanded the chief judge. A negative answer was given. The chief judge and the procurator fiscal then by turns questioned and cross-questioned the prisoner in the most subtle manner, to induce him state the degree of relationship subsisting between himself and Agnes; but he either refused to respond to their queries, or else answered direct ones by means of a positive denial. The lieutenant of the sbirri was at length called upon to give an account of the discovery of the dead body and the suspicious circumstances which had led to the arrest of Wagner. Two of these circumstances appeared to be very strong against him. The first was the soiled and blood- stained appearance of the garments which were found in his chamber; the other was the exclamation&mdash;&ldquo;But how know you that it is Agnes who is murdered They can&#39;t get at you through the courts,--the law can&#39;t get you, Dyke&#39;s pistol missed fire for just your benefit, and you even escaped Caraher&#39;s six inches of plugged gas pipe. Just what are we going to do with you &rdquo; &ldquo;I should only think of you as my own dear Fernand For she pondered on her native land, now, perhaps, far&mdash;oh &rdquo; &ldquo;Die, fiend thou may&rsquo;st deck thy brow with flowers, and adorn thy garments with the richest gems&mdash;thou may&rsquo;st elicit the shouts of admiring myriads, and proceed attended by guards ready to hew down those who would treat thee with disrespect&mdash;thou may&rsquo;st quit the palace of a mighty sovereign to repair to a palace of thine own&mdash;and in thy hands thou may&rsquo;st hold the destinies of millions of human beings; but thou canst not subdue the still small voice that whispers reproachfully in thine ear, nor pluck from thy bosom the undying worm. Though Ibrahim Pasha felt acutely, yet his countenance, as we have before said, expressed nothing&mdash;he was still sufficiently master of his emotions to retain them pent up in his own breast; and if he could not appear perfectly happy, he would not allow the world to perceive that his soul harbored secret care. He entered the palace now destined to become his abode, and found himself the lord and master of an establishment such as no Christian monarch in Europe possessed. But as he passed through marble halls and perfumed corridors lined with prostrate slaves&mdash;as he contemplated the splendor and magnificence, the wealth and the luxury, by which he was now surrounded&mdash;and as he even dwelt upon the hope&mdash;nay, the more than hope, the conviction, that he should full soon be blest with the hand of a being whose ravishing beauty was ever present to his mental vision&mdash;that still small voice which he could not hush, appeared to ask what avail it was for a man, if he gain the whole world but lose his own soul Alas Over thirty thousand hides had been already collected, cured, and stowed away in the house, which, together with what we should collect, and the Pilgrim would bring down from San Francisco, would make out her cargo. The thought that we were actually going up for the last time, and that the next time we went round San Diego point it would be &quot;homeward bound,&quot; brought things so near a close, that we felt as though we were just there, though it must still be the greater part of a year before we could see Boston. I spent one evening, as had been my custom, at the oven with the Sandwich Islanders; but it was far from being the usual noisy, laughing time. It has been said, that the greatest curse to each of the South Sea islands, was the first man who discovered it; and every one who knows anything of the history of our commerce in those parts, knows how much truth there is in this; and that the white men, with their vices, have brought in diseases before unknown to the islanders, and which are now sweeping off the native population of the Sandwich Islands, at the rate of one fortieth of the entire population annually. They seem to be a doomed people. The curse of a people calling themselves Christian, seems to follow them everywhere; and even here, in this obscure place, lay two young islanders, whom I had left strong, active young men, in the vigor of health, wasting away under a disease, which they would never have known but for their intercourse with Christianized Mexico and people from Christian America. One of them was not so ill; and was moving about, smoking his pipe, and talking, and trying to keep up his spirits; but the other, who was my friend, and Aikane--Hope, was the most dreadful object I had ever seen in my life: his eyes sunken and dead, his cheeks fallen in against his teeth, his hands looking like claws; a dreadful cough, which seemed to rack his whole shattered system, a hollow whispering voice, and an entire inability to move himself. There he lay, upon a mat, on the ground, which was the only floor of the oven, with no medicine, no comforts, and no one to care for, or help him, but a few Kanakas, who were willing enough, but could do nothing. The sight of him made me sick, and faint. Poor fellow But when, suddenly awaking from that profound meditation, she started from her seat with flashing eyes&mdash;heaving bosom&mdash;and an expression of countenance denoting a fixed determination to accomplish some deed from which her better feelings vainly bade her to abstain:&mdash;when she drew her tall&mdash;her even majestic form up to its full height, the drapery shadowing forth every contour of undulating bust and exquisitely modeled limb&mdash;while her haughty lip curled in contempt of any consideration save her own indomitable will&mdash;she appeared rather a heroine capable of leading an Amazonian army, than a woman to whom the sighing swain might venture to offer up the incense of love. There was something awful in the aspect of this mysterious being&mdash;something ineffably grand and imposing in her demeanor&mdash;as she thus suddenly rose from her almost recumbent posture, and burst into the attitude of a resolute and energetic woman. Drawing the wrapper around her form, she lighted a lamp, and was about to quit the chamber, when her eyes suddenly encountered the mild and benignant glance which the portrait of a lady appeared to cast upon her. This portrait, which hung against the wall precisely opposite to the bed, represented a woman of about thirty years of age&mdash;a woman of a beauty much in the same style as that of Nisida, but not marred by anything approaching to a sternness of expression. On the contrary, if an angel had looked through those mild black eyes, their glances could not have been endowed with a holier kindness; the smiles of good spirits could not be more plaintively sweet than those which the artist had made to play upon the lips of that portrait. Yet, in spite of this discrepancy between the expression of Nisida&rsquo;s countenance and that of the lady who had formed the subject of the picture, it was not difficult to perceive a certain physical likeness between the two; nor will the reader be surprised when we state that Nisida was gazing on the portrait of her deceased mother. And that gaze&mdash;oh &rdquo; &ldquo;No; I will not quit this suppliant attitude until you shall have granted my request&mdash;my prayer,&rdquo; said Nisida. &ldquo;Refuse me not, my Fernand. Oh &quot;--&quot;Hallo There are times when it appals me and there are times when it thrills me with a sweetness and a happiness that I have not known since she died. The vagueness of it Me, I&#39;m alretty, see I hev der guhn.&quot; &quot;They&#39;ve jumped the ranch, little girl,&quot; said Annixter, putting one arm around Hilma. &quot;They&#39;re in our house now. I&#39;m off. Go to Derrick&#39;s and wait for me there.&quot; She put her arms around his neck. &quot;You&#39;re going</div>
