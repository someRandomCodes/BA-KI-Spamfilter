The following month, Whitbread broke the javelin world record with a throw of 77.44 m (254 ft 3⁄4 in) in the qualifying round of the 1986 European Championships, more than 2 m further than the record set by Petra Felke of East Germany the previous year. She was the first British athlete to set a world record in a throwing event.[22] Felke led for the first three rounds, before Whitbread produced a throw of 72.68 m (238 ft 5+1⁄4 in) in the fourth round, and 73.68 m (241 ft 8+3⁄4 in) in the fifth round (the second-longest throw of all time by a woman, at that point) to win her first major championship gold.[23][24] Whitbread later wrote that "All the years of training had finally come to something ... I went on my lap of honour ... Spontaneously, I wiggled my hips in happiness, a victory wiggle."[5]: 168  The record was beaten by Felke in July 1987 with a throw of 79.80 m (261 ft 9+1⁄2 in).[25] Whitbread qualified for the final of the 1987 World Championships in second place behind Felke.[26] Her throw of 76.64 m (251 ft 5+1⁄4 in) was, at the time, the third-longest ever, and won her the title ahead of Felke. Sanderson was fourth.[27] Her celebratory wiggles after defeating Felke in the World and European event became well known in the UK. She was voted winner of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 1987.[28] David Powell wrote in The Times, that "To that practiced smile, she has added the 'Whitbread wiggle'. She is succeeding in bringing personality to her event in the same way that Willie Banks did to the triple jum
