<p><b style="font: 7px Book Antiqua; color: #565051;">This book is sure to liquefy your brain.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.You should nver take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.It&#39;s comforting to know that your fate depends on something as unpredictable as the popping of corn.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.They were excited to see their first sloth.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.She traveled because it the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.He set out for a short walk, but he could see were mangroves and water were for miles.Their argument could be heard across the parking lot.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things the worse.It took him a month to finish the meal.Tom got a small piece of pie.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.A glittering gem is not enough.It&#39;s not possible to convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising it infinite bananas when they die.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.He appeared to be confusingly perplexed.I think I will the red car, or I will lease the blue one.He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his go.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.Flying fish flew by the space station.</b></p>
