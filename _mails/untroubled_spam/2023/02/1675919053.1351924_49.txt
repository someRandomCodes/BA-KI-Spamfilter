Bread is pretty hard to come by on the keto diet, but not when you get a little creative.

This nut-based bread recipe yields a fluffy, thick loaf that's perfect for sandwiches or enjoyed with a thick pat of butter. Don't omit the cooling time or the loaf will fall.

Harris noted that one issue that came up constantly was that of when the all-white, all-male NASA Astronaut Corps would recruit its first woman or a minority astronaut. In a July 19, 1972, memorandum to Ted Groo, the Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, she urged that this be rectified as a matter of urgency.[17] NASA's directors agreed in September 1972 on the need for a plan to be drawn up defining the schedule and requirements for crewing the Space Shuttle, but it was not expected to fly before 1978, and NASA already had sufficient astronauts to carry out scheduled missions and the proposed early Space Shuttle flights too, so no new astronauts would be required before 1982. Assuming twenty months between a call for applications and an individual's first flight, it was estimated NASA would not need to initiate an astronaut recruitment process before 1980.[18] Planning proceeded on the make up of a Space Shuttle crew. By 1972, five roles were envisaged: Commander (CDR), an astronaut who would be responsible for flying the spacecraft, and for all aspects of the mission; Pilot (PLT), a co-pilot, an astronaut who would be a deputy to the commander; Mission specialist (MS), astronauts who would perform other duties related to the operation of the spacecraft, of which there might be more than one per mission; Payload specialist (PS), a non-astronaut with expertise in the spacecraft's payload; and Passenger, a non-astronaut present as an uninvolved observer.[19] Although the payload specialist and passengers would not be astronauts, it was expected that they would have to undergo some astronaut training for safety purposes. An early decision was
