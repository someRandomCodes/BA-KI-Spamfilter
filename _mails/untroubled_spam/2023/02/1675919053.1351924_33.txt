<p><b style="font: 8.5px Browallia New; color: #306EFF;">The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.It took me too long to realize that the ceiling hadn&#39;t been painted to look like the sky.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.The clock within this blog and the clock on my laptop are 1 hour different from each other.Red is greener than purple, for sure.She couldn&#39;t decide of the glass was half empty or half full so she drank it.Courage and stupidity were ll he had.To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn&#39;t quite go as expected.He is no James Bond; his is Roger Moore.The lake is a long way from .The crowd yells and screams for more memes.Giving directions that the mountains are to the west works when you can see them.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.There&#39;s a growing trend among teenagers of using frisbees as go-cart wheels.The hawk didn&rsquo;t understand why the ground squirrels didn&rsquo;t want to be his .He found his art progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin.I met an interesting turtle while the song on the radio blasted away.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.Don&#39;t put peanut butter on the dog&#39;s nose.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.</b></p>
