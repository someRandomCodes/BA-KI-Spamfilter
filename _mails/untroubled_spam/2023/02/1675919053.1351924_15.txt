<p><b style="font: 9.5px Narkisim; color: #992600;">I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.Everybody should read Chaucer to improve their everyday vocabulary.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.The mysterious diary records the voice.It took me too long to realize that the ceiling hadn&#39;t been painted to look like the sky.Jenny made the announcement that her baby was an alien.She had convinced her kids that any mushroom found on the ground would kill them if they touched it.There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.You bite up because of your lower jaw.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in oder to be with her.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.waiting for exceptional things to just happen.Beach-combing replaced wine tasting as his obsession.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.He shaved the peach to prove a point.He had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.He went on a whiskey and lost three days.He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.She advised him to come back at once.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Narkisim; color: #992600;">The hummingbird&#39;s wings blurred while it eagerly sipped the sugar water from the feeder.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.The wooden spoon couldn&rsquo;t cut but left emotional scars.you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.The anaconda was the greatest criminal mastermind in this part of the neighborhood.Weather is not trivial - it&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re standing in it.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.The efficiency we have at removing trash has made creating trash more acceptable.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.He learned the hardest lesson of his lif and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the class.She tilted her head back and let whip cream stream into her mouth while taking a bath.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.Seek , but always be prepared for random cats.Gwen had her best sleep ever on her bed of nails.He put heat on the wound to see what would grow.I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realNot people who wander are lost.Joe discovered that cones make excellent megaphones.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.She found it strange that people use their cellphones to actually talk to one another.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.</b></p>
