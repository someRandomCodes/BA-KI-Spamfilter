Did you know that belly fat is worse than smoking 20 cigarettes a day?
http://www.translator-divce.rest/11298-161-5294-33995/bruce/tindex11.html
The fat that surrounds your organs is slowly choking and suffocating them.

Causing type 2 diabetes....

Increasing the risks of heart disease..
http://www.translator-divce.rest/11298-161-5294-33995/bruce/tindex12.html
Sexual dysfunction...
http://www.translator-divce.rest/11298-161-5294-33995/bruce/tindex13.html
And horrible high blood pressure.

Not to mention, it looks pretty awful.

Sorry to be so direct, but sometimes I feel like I have to when it comes to health matters as important as these..

And if you think you have nothing to worry about because you’re on a’ diet’ and you exercise, think again…
http://www.translator-divce.rest/11298-161-5294-33995/bruce/tindex14.html
Because according to verified independent scientific studies, diets fail on average 95% of the time…

And exercise makes you just want to eat more… and many times eating more calories than what you burn…

Which is exactly what happened to an overweight, on the brink of a heart attack 44-year-old photojournalist…

Who tried every single diet and exercise under the sun to no avail and nearly died while on assignment in the Amazon Rainforest…

But by the grace of God, he would soon stumble upon a 10-second morning release…

That helped him supercharge his metabolism and destroy all his fat cells…

Leading him to lose 74 pounds in mere weeks!

Melissa

P.S Don’t wait around… this is your chance to destroy your belly fat without restrictive dieting or painful exercising…

Just like what Susan did not too long ago…

In March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto Ark Royal and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of 812 Squadron for self-defence. After a brief refit, Argus sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to Ark Royal. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of 800X Squadron were also embarked to protect the ship against the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors that patrolled the Bay of Biscay and the Eastern Atlantic. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.[31] In late August to early September, Argus transported 24 Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF to Murmansk, Russia.[32][33] She then ferried a dozen Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 828 Squadron to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of 804 Squadron on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied Eagle back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. Argus loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from 818 Squadron and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8 November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in Operation Perpetual, sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. Ark Royal was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced Argus to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.[34] 1942–1946 Force H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and Argus loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some Supermarine Spitfire fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to Eagle and embarked nine Fairey Fulmar fighters of 807 Squadron. The plan for Operation Spot
