<p><b style="font: 5px Gulim; color: #000080;">David proudly graduated from high school top of his class at age 97.A quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months.My uncle&#39;s favorite pastime was building cars out of noodles.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.Mom didn&rsquo;t understand why no one else wanted a hot tub full of jello.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.I enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.She wanted to be rescued, but if it was Tuesday and raining.They wandered into a strange Tiki bar on the edge of the small beach town.The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.When was tight, he&#39;d his lunch from the local wishing well.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.More RVs were seen in the storage lot than at the campground.He uses onomatopoeia as a weapon of mental destruction.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of , Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.The teens wondered what was kept in the red shed on the far edge of the school grounds.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.There are few things better in than a slice of pie.The clock within this blog and the clock on my laptop are 1 hour different from each other.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.Lets be unique together until we realize we are the same.Erin accidentally created a universe.</b></p>
