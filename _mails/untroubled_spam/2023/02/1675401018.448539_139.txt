<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;allow you to bend your hips and legs towards your chest</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;support your internal organs</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;is connected to your diaphragm which allows you to walk and breathe.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">In other words, your psoas has a direct influence on your fight or flight response!</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If the psoas get tight and weak, it can be a real pain but working certain muscles and doing the certain exercise cobinations provide easy fixes.</span></p>

stiffness<br />


pain while walking or moving<br />
