<p><span style="font-size:14px;">My friend Sharon just lost 34 pounds, SEVENTEEN of those in the first few weeks... right after she started this simple morning routine...</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Prior to this, nothing worked for her... at best she&#39;d lose weight one week, just to gain it back the next.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:14px;">But when she started&nbsp;doing THIS every morning, things rapidly shifted...</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><a href="http://www.clothesdeserve.shop/rmbrxrljgea/wqaamj6692dghwfptha/giv3DORqnOEsD9SCmm09YdQzB3ETZClwF-E-6XCXhfc/dc05z62fh1HkByh6s8ZI1C0lL5t3M5KwgjjNhQl4hpE">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Half-glass of water + This = Smaller Belly Every Morning</a></span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Hope this helps you as much as it has Sharon :)</span></p>

<p><b style="font: 5px Apple Chancery; color: #2727dd;">Trash covered the landscape like sprinkles do a birthday cake.Flesh-colored yoga pants were far worse than even he feared.Just go ahead and press that button.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.Mom didn&rsquo;t understand why no one else wanted a hot tub full of jello.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.Just because the water is red doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t drink it.A quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months.Pantyhose and heels are an interesting choice of attire for the beach.He had reached the point where he was paranoid about being paranoid.There&#39;s a growing trend among teenagers of using frisbees as go-cart wheels.put on these earmuffs because I can&#39;t you hear.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.He watched the dancing piglets with panda bear tummies in the swimming pool.He dreamed of eating green apples with worms.Don&#39;t put peanut butter on the dog&#39;s nose.A quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months.There are few things better in than a slice of pie.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.Lets be unique together until we realize we are the same.Tomorrow will bring something , so as a memory.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Apple Chancery; color: #2727dd;">Just because the water is red doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t drink it.you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.Greetings from the galaxy MACS0647-JD, or what we .He wondered if it could be called a beach if there was no sand.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.If eating three-egg omelets causes weight-gain, budgie eggs are a good substitute.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.She wanted to be rescued, but if it was Tuesday and raining.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.Fluffy pink unicorns are a popular status symbol among macho men.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.Red is greener than purple, for sure.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.You&#39;re good at English when you know the difference between a man eating chicken and a man-eating chicken.Kevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.He had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.His rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.I enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.Nobody has encountered an explosive daisy and lived to tell the tale.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve written over fifty novelsThe irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.The estate agent quickly marked out his territory on the dance floor.He found his art progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.</b></p>
