<p><b style="font: 6px Aharoni; color: #34282C;">underestimate the willingness of the greedy to throw you under the bus.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.Nobody has encountered an explosive daisy and lived to tell the tale.The old apple revels in its authority.The worst thing about being at the top of the career ladder is that there&#39;s a long way to fall.He drank before spitting it out.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of , Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.So long and thanks for the fish.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.The group quickly understood that toxic waste was the most effective barrier to use against the zombies.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.The stranger officiates the meal.He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the class.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.He decided water-skiing on a frozen lake wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.She wore green lipstick like a fashion icon.The key lime pie is still up for debate.I met an interesting turtle while the song on the radio blasted away.He was the of the club who didn&#39;t like plum pudding.I&rsquo;m a living furnace.Whenever he saw a red flag warning at the beach he grabbed his surfboard.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.A quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months.There&#39;s an art to getting your way, and spitting olive pits across the table isn&#39;t it.</b></p>
