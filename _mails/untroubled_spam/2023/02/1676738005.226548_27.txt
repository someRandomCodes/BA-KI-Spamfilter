We've created what may well be the most comprehensive, step-by-step system to transform a regular homeowner or apartment dweller into an independent, self-sufficient homesteader.

We would like to share with you all the projects we made here in our small paradise in minute detail so that you can start implementing them on your land or in your house and profit for the rest of your life.

We'll also cover subjects in depth such as water, food preservation, off grid power, medicinal garden, you name it. We want to put in your hands helpful how-to illustrations … easy to follow, step-by-step advice … brilliant tips and ingenious time-savers.

From all the projects you'll find in The Self-Sufficient Backyard I'm pretty sure you'll find some that are suitable for your property.

powerful and accurate striking ability from outside the area, as well as his ability to make late attacking runs into the box. His preferred role is as a right winger or outside forward in a 4–3–3 formation, a position which allows him to beat opponents, cut into the centre, and either shoot towards goal or link-up with midfielders and create chances for teammates with his stronger left foot; he is also capable of playing on the left flank. Although he often serves as a link between the forwards and midfielders, due to his tactical versatility, intelligence, stamina, vision and defensive work-rate, as well as his technical, athletic, and physical attributes, he is also capable of playing in several other positions, and has been deployed as a second striker or inside forward, as an attacking midfielder, in a central role as a classic number 10 playmaker behind the forwards (known as the trequartista role, in Italian), in particular under his Juventus manager Maurizio Sarri, in a deeper midfield role as an offensive-minded central midfielder (known as the mezzala role, in Italian), further up the pitch as an outright forward, as a false 9, or even as a wide midfielder, full-back, or wing-back along the right side of the pitch.[nb 1] He is also known for his accuracy from set-pieces[69][70][71] and penalties.[72][73] He has cited compatriots Francesco Totti, Giancarlo Antognoni, Roberto Baggio, and Alessandro Del Piero as his footballing idols and role models; his role on the pitch and style of play have also led pundits to compare Bernardeschi to these aforementioned players as well as Michel Platini.[12][53][74][75] He has also described Ukrainian former striker Andriy Shevchenko as one of his major influences in his youth.[76] Due to his technique and elegant playing style, Bernardeschi has been nicknamed Brunelleschi, as a reference to the famous Italian Renaissance designer and architect from Florence.[3][77] While Bernardeschi has largely drawn praise in the media for his ability, talent, and playing style, in July 2017, following rumours of Bernardeschi's possible transfer to Fiorentina's rivals Juventus, and the possibility of him inheriting the club's number 10 shirt, former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi stated in an interview that although he felt Bernardeschi had "enormous p
