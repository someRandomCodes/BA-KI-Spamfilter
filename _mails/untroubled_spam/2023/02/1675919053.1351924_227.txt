<p><b style="font: 9.5px Lao; color: #6960EC;">He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to cigarettes.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.The rusty nail stood erect, angled at a 45-degree angle, just waiting for the barefoot to come along.The door slammed on the watermelon.If eating three-egg omelets causes weight-gain, budgie eggs are a good substitute.Purple is best city in the forest.wait outside of the house.As the years pass by, we know owners look more and more like their dogs.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.She finally understood that grief was her love with no place for it to go.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.The elephant didn&#39;t want to talk about the person in the room.She was too short to see over the fence.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.Everybody should read Chaucer to improve their everyday vocabulary.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.She looked at the masterpiece hanging in the museum but she could think is that her five-year-old could do better.He always wore his sunglasses at night.The reservoir water level continued to lower while we enjoyed our long shower.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.They&#39;re playing the piano while flying in the plane.</b></p>
