Brad Howard here=3DE2=3D80=3DA6
We just wrapped up a HUGE 32%=
 win on Metabo Flex just in time for the
weekend when traffic converts th=
e hardest. I=3DE2=3D =3D80=3D99ll admit,
it=3DE2=3D80=3D99s RARE to get b=
ig wins like this.
Just to be clear, the conversion rate went up 32% with=
 no drop in
the=3DC2=3DA0AOV. That=3DE2=3D80=3D99s HUGE.
Not only that,=
 we have a new email creative that=3DE2=3D80=3D99s dropping
tons of click=
s, and we want to make sure you have=3D it.
_Time to get all the cannons =
firing._
Remember, at 85% commissions plus the strong AOVs we=3DE2=3D80=
=3D =3D99re
seeing, it means payouts are extremely high. Higher than what=
 you=3DE2=3D
=3D80=3D99d normally see.
Also, just a small note, if you =
sent Jackie an email and sh=3D e
hasn=3DE2=3D80=3D99t replied, there was =
a small random outage on that email
ser=3D vice last Saturday so it may b=
e that your email to her got
=3DE2=3D80=3D9Cblack h=3D oled.=3DE2=3D80=3D=
9D First time in my 20 years of doing
this I=3DE2=3D80=3D99ve run int=3D =
o that issue=3DE2=3D80=3DA6 lol.
So if you need anything just shoot her a=
n email and she=3DE2=3D =3D80=3D99ll
get you fixed up with commission bum=
ps (please provide your CB ID =3D if
you=3DE2=3D80=3D99re after 85%), ema=
il swipes, and anything else you may
need =3D ( jackie@jvwithae.com )
(=
Note: She has already sent out the new swipe to a few peop=3D le over
the=
 last 2 days. No need to email again if you already got it.)
Last Thing:=

=3D If you need links, just go here and fire away. /3D
Here=3DE2=3D80=

Stay cool,
Brad
