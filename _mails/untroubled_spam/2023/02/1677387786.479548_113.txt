You will shake your head in disbelief when you see this…
http://www.walmartsurvys.us/11554-8-5446-33995/bruce/tindex10.html
When an exotic doctor gave this unusual bedtime brew to overweight, diabetic patients…

A whopping 94% of the test subjects SLASHED their blood sugar down to a “near-perfect” level – in less than 6 weeks.

Not to mention, they lost an average of 28.3 lbs!

http://www.walmartsurvys.us/11554-8-5446-33995/bruce/tindex11.html

Imagine stopping type 2 diabetes dead in its tracks…

And not having to worry about diabetes-related complications anymore.

The craziest part? You can make your own brew in less than 30 seconds a day… with a few dirt-cheap supermarket items.
http://www.walmartsurvys.us/11554-8-5446-33995/bruce/tindex12.html
And for the first time ever, the doctor has decided to release the secret recipe of this unusual bedtime brew to the public…

… in hopes of exposing the truth about the $50 billion-dollar diabetes industry.

You need to check out this controversial video right now before it’s taken down.

Committed to your success,

Sabrina

Constitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as Ukraine or Byelorussia (SSRs), or federations, such as Russia or Transcaucasia (SFSRs),[122] all four being the founding republics who signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December 1922. In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of Russia's Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSRs. In 1929, Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan SSR. With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status.[153] In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of Ukraine and Bessarabia and Ukrainian SSR. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (SSRs) were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation. Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956. Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below).[154] While nominally a union of equals, in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by Russians. The domination was so absolute that for most of its existence, the country was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as ‘Russia’. While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and area), most powerful, and most highly developed. The RSFSR was also the industrial center of the Soviet Union. Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the country's federal structure was ‘window dressing’ for Russian dominance. For that reason, the people of the USSR were usually called ‘Russians’, not ‘Soviets’, since ‘everyone knew who really ran the sh
