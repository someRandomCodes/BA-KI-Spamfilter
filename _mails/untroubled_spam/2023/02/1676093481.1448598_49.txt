						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What is a vehicle tracker?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quite simply, it&rsquo;s a small electronic box that fits inside your vehicle, which sends signals with details of where it is and what speed it is travelling at.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This super useful data comes from the GPS Satellite system, which also feeds position data on your vehicles to all your satnavs and devices.</span></p>





						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>In a word? Data. </i>These <a href="http://www.skilledjournal.shop/wbfmncvud/masg6659bvhogek/z1raRITjk4C1HEAPDaz6HOkdvuCdAiv-i4HyRSFSMxM/E8ZQ-nptLvEU_ytQeEX0F9aV2c6S8JjiapLnV--fKfI">modern tracking systems</a> give you and your company huge amounts of powerful data that will let you run your fleet more efficiently &ndash; which means <i>saving a lot of money</i>.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Most importantly, you can also <a href="http://www.skilledjournal.shop/wbfmncvud/masg6659bvhogek/z1raRITjk4C1HEAPDaz6HOkdvuCdAiv-i4HyRSFSMxM/E8ZQ-nptLvEU_ytQeEX0F9aV2c6S8JjiapLnV--fKfI">monitor driver behaviour data</a>, such as harsh acceleration and braking, time using the cruise control, pedal position, rpm bands, fuel consumption, and engine diagnostics. This nifty little device will stop your workers driving like maniacs in a flash!</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">And all of this rich telematics information is then fed back to you, directly on your PC or smart phone.</span></p>

<p><b style="font: 6px Leelawadee UI; color: #736AFF;">I want more detailed information.Everyone was curious about the large white blimp that appeared overnight.You bite up because of your lower jaw.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.8 of 25 is the same as 25 of 8 and one of them is much easier to do in your head.Tomatoes make weapons when water balloons aren&rsquo;t available.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one knew how to play bongos.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.He uses onomatopoeia as a weapon of mental destruction.Be careful with that butter knife.They wandered into a strange Tiki bar on the edge of the small beach town.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.Tuesdays are fre if you bring a gnome costume.Trash covered the landscape like sprinkles do a birthday cake.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.The tortoise jumped into the lake with dreams of becoming a sea turtle.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.You have no right to yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a lockpick.We will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.There&#39;s an art to getting your way, and spitting olive pits across the table isn&#39;t it.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain of her strangeness.She says she has the ability to hear the soundtrack of yourlife.He realized there had been several deaths on this road, but his concern rose when he saw the exact number.</b></p>
