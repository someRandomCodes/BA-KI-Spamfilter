<p>&rdquo; demanded Manuel, indignantly. &ldquo;Think you that I shall betray the secrets of your dwelling, wherever and whatever it may be Then did she recall to mind every interchange of thought that had passed between them through the language of the fingers; and she could fix upon nothing which, emanating from herself, had given him offense. Had he then really lost his senses &rdquo; cried Wagner, moved by the mysterious warning those words appeared to convey. The demon extended his arm, and chanted in deep, sonorous tones, the following incantation: &ldquo;Ye powers of darkness who obey Eternally my potent sway, List to thy sovereign master&rsquo;s call &quot; &quot;Oh, I know they will come through the car and rob us,&quot; wailed the school-teachers. The lady with the little children went back to bed, and Annixter, assured that the trouble was over, did likewise. But nobody slept. From berth to berth came the sound of suppressed voices talking it all over, formulating conjectures. Certain points seemed to be settled upon, no one knew how, as indisputable. The highwaymen had been four in number and had stopped the train by pulling the bell cord. A brakeman had attempted to interfere and had been shot. The robbers had been on the train all the way from San Francisco. The drummer named Max remembered to have seen four &quot;suspicious-looking characters&quot; in the smoking-car at Lathrop, and had intended to speak to the conductor about them. This drummer had been in a hold-up before, and told the story of it over and over again. At last, after what seemed to have been an hour&#39;s delay, and when the dawn had already begun to show in the east, the locomotive backed on to the train again with a reverberating jar that ran from car to car. At the jolting, the school-teachers screamed in chorus, and the whiskered gentleman stopped snoring and thrust his head from his curtains, blinking at the Pintsch lights. It appeared that he was an Englishman. &quot;I say,&quot; he asked of the drummer named Max, &quot;I say, my friend, what place is this Must they come from the parts of the world that are uninhabited She was to be arrested. The countrywoman&#39;s fear of the Jail nipped and bit eagerly at her unwilling heels. She hurried off, thinking to return to her post after the policeman should have gone away. But when, at length, turning back, she tried to find the boarding-house, she suddenly discovered that she was on an unfamiliar street. Unwittingly, no doubt, she had turned a corner. She could not retrace her steps. She and Hilda were lost. &quot;Mammy, I&#39;m tired,&quot; Hilda complained. Her mother picked her up. &quot;Mammy, where&#39;re we gowun, mammy Suddenly she became aware of the gradual disappearance of the three nuns; as she descended, the wall seemed to rise slowly upward and cover them from her view. Then, for an instant there was a slight shock given to the platform whereon the chair was placed&mdash;as if it rested on something beneath. But no;&mdash;the fearful descent still went on&mdash;for, when she again stretched forth her hand to touch the walls, they appeared to be slowly rising&mdash;rising &rdquo; &ldquo;Alas &mdash;was it reality or imagination &rdquo; cried the brigand pompously: &ldquo;open&mdash;and fear not.&rdquo; The bolts were drawn back&mdash;a chain fell heavily on the stone floor inside&mdash;and the door opened, revealing the form of an old and venerable-looking man, with a long white beard. He held a lamp in his hand: and, by its fitful glare, his countenance, of the Jewish cast, manifested an expression denoting the terror which he vainly endeavored to conceal. &ldquo;Enter. Signor Stephano,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;But wherefore here so late &ldquo;Oh Want any money Everyone was. But no need of going around with a long face and wearing a dirty coat just because some day or other you were going to die. Life was good. People were meant to be happy. You desired proof of this &quot; &quot;I&#39;m going away, sir.&quot; The Governor did not answer. Staring at the ledge of the desk, he seemed lost in thought. There was a long silence. Then, at length, Presley said: &quot;How are you getting on, Governor Could charity be had for the asking But it overflowed with resistless violence the kingdoms of Armenia ^ Deaf and dumb must I appear&mdash;deaf and dumb must I yet be deemed for a short space. But to-night, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, you will meet me, Demetrius, in the garden of the Riverola mansion;&mdash;and then I will conduct you to an apartment where we may confer without fear of being overheard&mdash;without danger of interruption.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not fail thee, lady,&rdquo; said the Greek, scarcely able to recover from the amazement into which Nisida&rsquo;s sudden revelation of her power of speech and hearing had thrown him: then, as an oppressive feeling seized upon his soul, he demanded, &ldquo;But Calanthe, lady, in the name of heaven Lomellino &quot; &quot;Why, fairly well, thank you, Harran. They&#39;re up to Sacramento just now to see my brother. I was thinking of going in with my brother into this hop business. But I had a letter from him this morning. He may not be able to meet me on this proposition. He&#39;s got other business on hand. If he pulls out--and he probably will--I&#39;ll have to go it alone, but I&#39;ll have to borrow. I had thought with his money and mine we would have enough to pull off the affair without mortgaging anything. As it is, I guess I&#39;ll have to see S. Behrman.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll be cursed if I would &rdquo; exclaimed Wagner, &ldquo;I offer thee my deepest gratitude for having permitted me to enter this sanctuary. But how camest thou to learn that I sought admittance hither my brain whirls when I reflect upon that hideous cruelty which made our mother the spectator of his dissection; for, even had he been a lover&mdash;even were she guilty&mdash;even if the suspicions of our father had all been well-founded&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Dwell not upon this frightful topic, my beloved Nisida he stood forth as the deliverer of his country; and the eyes and wishes of the people were turned towards a hero who suffered in their cause. The chiefs of the law and of the army had pledged their salvation to support him with their lives and fortunes; but in the hour of danger they were silent and afraid; and, after waiting seven days on the hills of Samarcand, he retreated to the desert with only sixty horsemen. The fugitives were overtaken by a thousand Getes, whom he repulsed with incredible slaughter, and his enemies were forced to exclaim, &quot;Timour is a wonderful man: fortune and the divine favor are with him.&quot; But in this bloody action his own followers were reduced to ten, a number which was soon diminished by the desertion of three Carizmians. ^ &rdquo; cried Flora, shuddering from head to foot, and contemplating her intended husband with the deepest solicitude. &ldquo;Yes, I was in a desperate state,&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;But Wagner came&mdash;he breathed words of hope in my ears, and I recovered rapidly; so rapidly and so completely that I feel not as if I had ever known indisposition save by name. I was, however, about to observe that there is an oratory in Signor Wagner&rsquo;s mansion; and there may the ceremony be performed. Fernand is, moreover, well acquainted with the language by which the deaf and dumb communicate their ideas; and through friendship for me he will break the tidings of my marriage to my sister.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it as you propose,&rdquo; said the grand vizier; then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, he added, speaking in a low and mysterious whisper: &ldquo;and if you will not shrink from the contact of the renegade at the altar of God&mdash;a renegade in name only, and not in heart&mdash;a renegade to suit his worldly purposes, and not from conviction&mdash;then shall I be present at the ceremony. Yes,&rdquo; he continued, perceiving that his aunt, his sister, and the young count surveyed him with mingled pleasure and amazement&mdash;&ldquo;yes, in a deep disguise I will quit the encampment and enter Florence, for it would grieve me deeply to be excluded from the solemn scene.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dearest Alessandro&mdash;for thus you will permit me still to call you,&rdquo; exclaimed his aunt, &ldquo;your words have made my happiness complete. Oh &quot;Mammy, I&#39;m hungry.&quot; There was no other way. It must come to that in the end. Why temporise, why put off the inevitable &rdquo; exclaimed the aunt, who had been an attentive listener to the preceding discourse. &ldquo;But your grand vizier, signor, must be very powerful to have a great army at his disposal.&rdquo; &ldquo;The grand vizier, lady,&rdquo; returned the Ottoman envoy, &ldquo;is second only to the sultan, and in him we see a reflection of the imperial majesty. At a sign from the great and potent Ibrahim every scimiter throughout this host of twenty thousand men would leap from its sheath in readiness to strike where and at whom he might choose to order. Nay, more, lady&mdash;he has the power to gather together mighty armies, so numerous that they would inundate Christendom as with a desolating sea. Allah be thanked cannot the reader conceive the anguish, the mortal anguish, she had ere now endured when her husband was heaping ashes on the reputation of her lover And you are sorry and you WILL be good to me if I will be your wife &rdquo; asked Agnes, in a wildly impassioned&mdash;almost hysterical tone. &ldquo;The voice of pity cannot refuse to heave a sigh for thy fall,&rdquo; was the response. &ldquo;If thou wast guilty in abandoning one who loved thee so tenderly, and whose earthly reliance was on thee, he, whom you did so abandon, has not the less need to ask pardon of thee. For he speedily forgot his darling Agnes&mdash;he traveled the world over, yet sought her not&mdash;her image was, as it were, effaced from his memory. But when accident&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh &rsquo;&rdquo; demanded Agnes, scarcely knowing whether to rejoice or weep at the marvelous transformation of her grandsire. &ldquo;Did I not ere now inform thee that thou wast forgotten until accident threw thee in my way to- night &ldquo;Margaretha,&rdquo; said Nisida, &ldquo;you must prepare to accompany me forthwith &mdash;of her recovery from that dreadful affliction which renders her so completely dependent upon your kindness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dearest father, you know how sincerely I am attached to my sister&mdash;how devoted she is to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Enough, enough &ldquo;&lsquo;Bring her near But I must torture ere I slay ye Nisida, I see that you do not credit my words,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;and yet I have told thee the solemn, sacred truth. But mine is a sad history and a dreadful fate; and if I thought that thou would&rsquo;st soothe my wounded spirit, console, and not revile me, pity, and not loathe me, I would tell thee all.&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak, Fernand, speak Hoop &quot; she exclaimed, with a long, deep breath, and again &quot;Oh</p>
