<p><b style="font: 7px Bahnschrift SemiBold; color: #357EC7;">It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.The manager of the fruit stand always sat and sold vegetables.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.After coating myself in vegetable oil I found my sucess rte skyrocketed.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this about?He was business when he wore his clown suit.Pink horses galloped across the sea.She couldn&#39;t understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.It was the first time he had ever seen someone cook dinner on an elephant.The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance.It&#39;s comforting to know that your fate depends on something as unpredictable as the popping of corn.Had he known what was going to happen, he would have stepped into the shower.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.He colored deep space a soft yellow.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.The tree fell unexpectedly short.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.Thigh-high in the water, the fisherman&rsquo;s hope for dinner turned to despair.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.There were a lot of paintings of monkeys waving bamboo sticks in the gallery.Mary plays the piano.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one knew how to play bongos.The virus had powers none of us knew existed.He had concluded that pigs must be able to fly in Hog Heaven.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.One small would change her , but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.Two seats were vacant.</b></p>
