Hello,


Perhaps you might be wondering why you have received this mail, but I can a=
ssure you that at the end, we both will be having discussion as to whatever=
 profitable business(es) we should invest our respective share(s) in. I was=
 assigned by three of my colleagues to seek for a foreign partner who will =
assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank =
abroad for a transfer of US(US$35,950,000.00 million) pending on our arriva=
l in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the ac=
count.

This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract =
awarded by our Ministry (The Federal Ministry of Agriculture, F.M.A) to an =
expatriate company who supplied Agricultural equipment to the Ministry. The=
 contract has been executed and payment made to the ORIGINAL contractor, re=
maining the over-invoiced amount of US$35,950,000.00 million, which we want=
 to transfer the fund out of the country for disbursement among ourselves (=
i.e You being the foreign counterpart, I and my other two colleagues). The =
transfer of this money can only be possible with your help being a foreigne=
r who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.

As Civil servants, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this=
 is the reason why I decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/you=
r company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (US$35,950,000.00 million=
), 15% of the total sum will be for you for assisting us from start to fini=
sh in this venture while 85% will be reserved for us.

We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing your convenient banking =
coordinate in a designated bank in your country where this fund would be tr=
ansferred. We intend coming over on the completion of this transfer to secu=
re our own share of the money.

Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements toward=
s the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before I cont=
acted you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we=
 demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction=
 to anybody.

We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray=
 us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. =
Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal i=
s acceptable by you, indicate your interest by sending your response via an=
 email to me including your working cellphone number.

Note: our President (Muhammadu Buhari) collaborated with Mr. Ibrahim Magu a=
s the EFCC chairman, (Economic Financial Crime Commission), to stop the jun=
ior ranked officers from siphoning funds out of the country. He sent differ=
ent publication to many countries in the world as propaganda to discourage =
all government Officials from transferring funds into an oversea account to=
 avoid and save-guard the country's economy.

Apparently, so that other government officials will not benefits from these=
 oil windfalls venture where he has been a culprit alone with his aides. Mo=
re details about this transaction will be given to you as soon as I receive=
 your positive response.

Note that the particular nature of your company's business is not necessary=
 needed for this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgen=
t response will be appreciated.

Yours faithfully,

Mr.George Emerah
