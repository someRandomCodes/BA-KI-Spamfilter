<div id=3D"output">&rdquo; she cried, throwing one of her snowy full arms r=
ound his neck, and looking earnestly, but yet tenderly on his countenance. =
&ldquo;Never, never shall I know happiness again until I have revisited Flo=
rence. Each day that passes without giving me a hope to see this aim fulfil=
led, increases my misery, adds to my uneasiness, augments my anxiety&mdash;=
so that in a short time my suspense will become intolerable. It is nearly s=
o already, Fernand&mdash;but pity me; yes&mdash;and help me, if you can The=
 siege, more especially of the castle, might have been a work of time; but =
he tempted, by the appearance of weakness, the sultan Mahmoud and his vizie=
r to descend into the plain, with ten thousand cuirassiers, forty thousand =
of his foot-guards, and one hundred and twenty elephants, whose tusks are s=
aid to have been armed with sharp and poisoned daggers. Against these monst=
ers, or rather against the imagination of his troops, he condescended to us=
e some extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and a =
rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the Moguls to smile at their own =
fears; and as soon as these unwieldy animals were routed, the inferior spec=
ies (the men of India) disappeared from the field. Timour made his triumpha=
l entry into the capital of Hindostan; and admired, with a view to imitate,=
 the architecture of the stately mosque; but the order or license of a gene=
ral pillage and massacre polluted the festival of his victory. He resolved =
to purify his soldiers in the blood of the idolaters, or Gentoos, who still=
 surpass, in the proportion of ten to one, the numbers of the Moslems. ^* I=
n this pious design, he advanced one hundred miles to the north-east of Del=
hi, passed the Ganges, fought several battles by land and water, and penetr=
ated to the famous rock of Coupele, the statue of the cow, ^ &rsquo; and no=
w I experienced just the same sensations as those which stunned and stupefi=
ed me on that evening at Naples when I first heard that Vitangela was the c=
hild of the public executioner. Several minutes must have passed while I wa=
s in this condition of comparative insensibility; or rather while I was a p=
rey to the stunning conviction that I was deceived by her whom I had loved =
so well and deemed so pure. When I awoke from that dread stupor all was sti=
ll in the dark avenue; not a footstep, not a whispering voice was heard. I =
hurried along amidst the trees, my soul racked with the cruelest suspicions=
 And yet I was not confident that it was positively my wife&rsquo;s voice =
that I had heard; and the more I pondered on the circumstance, the more anx=
ious was I to arrive at the conviction that I had indeed been deceived by s=
ome voice closely resembling hers. I accordingly hurried back to the arbor =
where I had last seen her in the company of several Florentine ladies. Joy =
animated my soul when I beheld Vitangela seated in that arbor, and in the v=
ery spot, too, where I had beheld her upward of an hour previously. But she=
 was now alone. &ldquo;&lsquo;Where are your friends my lord &quot; she que=
stioned. With a movement of infinite tenderness and affection she slid her =
arms around his neck, still crying a little. The sensation of her warm body=
 in his embrace, the feeling of her smooth, round arm, through the thinness=
 of her sleeve, pressing against his cheek, thrilled Annixter with a deligh=
t such as he had never known. He bent his head and kissed her upon the nape=
 of her neck, where the delicate amber tint melted into the thick, sweet sm=
elling mass of her dark brown hair. She shivered a little, holding him clos=
er, ashamed as yet to look up. Without speech, they stood there for a long =
minute, holding each other close. Then Hilma pulled away from him, mopping =
her tear-stained cheeks with the little moist ball of her handkerchief. &qu=
ot;What do you say &quot; It was Dyke&#39;s voice, and the next instant he =
shot into view in the open square in front of the house. &quot;Oh, my God &=
rdquo; she exclaimed, a torrent of tears now gushing from her eyes. &ldquo;=
That voice Proofs--we demand your proofs Let&#39;s hear it.&quot; Presley t=
urned away with a gesture of discouragement, his heart sinking. On the stre=
et corner he stood for a long time, frowning in trouble and perplexity. His=
 suspicions had been only too well founded. So long ago as a week, the Hoov=
ens had exhausted all their little store of money. For seven days now they =
had been without resources, unless, indeed, work had been found; &quot;and =
what,&quot; he asked himself, &quot;what work in God&#39;s name could they =
find to do here in the city With folded arms, compressed lips, and remorsel=
ess, though ashy pale countenance, the old Lord of Arestino stands near the=
 rack; and if his eyes can for a moment quit that feast which they devour s=
o greedily, it is but to glance with demoniac triumph toward Manuel d&rsquo=
;Orsini, whom an atrocious refinement of cruelty, suggested by the vengeful=
 count himself, has made a spectator of that appalling scene Are not the Ro=
mans in a manner gotten within the city how intent, how earnest, how enthus=
iastic it was &rdquo; &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; answered the demon. &ldquo;But =
the terms&mdash;the conditions&mdash;the compact &rdquo; exclaimed the weep=
ing Flora, as she threw herself into Nisida&rsquo;s outstretched arms. And =
the young wife and the young woman embraced each other tenderly&mdash;for d=
eep regrets and pungent remorse at last attuned the mind of Nisida to sweet=
 and holy sympathy. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Nisida, &ldquo;sit down by =
my side, and listen to the explanations which I have promised. Give me your=
 hand. Flora, dear Flora, let me retain it in mine; for at the last hour, a=
nd when I am about to leave this fair and beauteous earth, I feel an ardent=
 longing to love those who walk upon its face, and to be loved by them in r=
eturn. But, alas, alas Nothing afterwards. I never saw her again. Her name =
was Celestine.&quot; The company raised a chorus of derision, and Osterman =
cried ironically: &quot;Say And how absurd a thing is it to pursue after li=
berty while we are alive, and yet to envy it to ourselves where it will be =
eternal how my blood boiled in my veins &rdquo; &ldquo;Mercy &quot; cried A=
nnixter. &quot;Aren&#39;t you ever going to learn any sense well&mdash;do I=
 recollect the reply which she gave me, giving fond assurance that my happi=
ness would alone be consulted.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas Here it had always stoppe=
d hitherto, stopped for a moment, and then, in spite of his efforts, had sl=
ipped from his grasp and faded back into the night. But now he wondered if =
he had been willing to put forth his utmost strength, after all. Had there =
not always been an element of dread in the thought of beholding the mystery=
 face to face &quot; insisted Garnett. &quot;Were the delegates--did you br=
ibe the delegates --what can they find to do &quot; he asked. Promptly the =
passengers surrounded him, voluble with questions. But he was in a bad temp=
er. &quot;I don&#39;t know anything more than you,&quot; he shouted angrily=
 &quot;It was a hold-up. I guess you know that, don&#39;t you &quot; &quot=
;N-no; I don&#39;t know what. I wanted the light, I wanted----&quot; She dr=
ew a deep breath, turning towards the window and spreading her pink finger-=
tips to the light. &quot;Oh, the SUN. I love the sun. See, put your hand th=
ere--here on the top of the vat--like that. Isn&#39;t it warm &quot; Hilma&=
#39;s low-pitched, almost husky voice trembled a little as she replied, &qu=
ot;Fighting--with guns--that&#39;s so terrible. Oh, those revolvers in the =
barn &quot; Two hands sprang aloft; the frozen reef-points and earings were=
 cast adrift, the halyards manned, and the sail gave out her increased canv=
as to the gale. All hands were kept on deck to watch the effect of the chan=
ge. It was as much as she could well carry, and with a heavy sea astern, it=
 took two men at the wheel to steer her. She flung the foam from her bows; =
the spray breaking aft as far as the gangway. She was going at a prodigious=
 rate. Still, everything held. Preventer braces were reeved and hauled taug=
ht; tackles got upon the backstays; and each thing done to keep all snug an=
d strong. The captain walked the deck at a rapid stride, looked aloft at th=
e sails, and then to windward; the mate stood in the gangway, rubbing his h=
ands, and talking aloud to the ship--&quot;Hurrah, old bucket &quot; She ma=
de a little helpless gesture with both her hands, smiling very sadly. &quot=
;As you see,&quot; she answered. As he talked, Presley was looking at her i=
ntently. Her dignity was a new element in her character and the certain sle=
nder effect of her figure, emphasised now by the long folds of the black go=
wn she wore, carried it almost superbly. She conveyed something of the impr=
ession of a queen in exile. But she had lost none of her womanliness; rathe=
r, the contrary. Adversity had softened her, as well as deepened her. Presl=
ey saw that very clearly. Hilma had arrived now at her perfect maturity; sh=
e had known great love and she had known great grief, and the woman that ha=
d awakened in her with her affection for Annixter had been strengthened and=
 infinitely ennobled by his death. What if things had been different Well, =
what more do you want to know &rdquo; cried Giulia, almost frantically. &ld=
quo;These diamonds were pledged to the Jew Isaachar ben Solomon, to raise t=
he sum with which thy last debt was paid, Manuel; and&mdash;but forgive me =
if I did not tell thee all this before&mdash;not half an hour has elapsed s=
ince&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped short; for she knew that the bandit o=
verheard every syllable she uttered. Nor had she time, even if she possesse=
d the power, to continue her most painful explanation; for scarcely had she=
 thus paused abruptly, when the door burst open, and the Count of Arestino =
stood in the presence of the guilty pair. CHAPTER XXIV. THE INJURED HUSBAND=
&mdash;THE GUILTY WIFE&mdash;AND THE INSOLENT LOVER. In fury of heart and a=
gony of mind, rushed the old lord into that apartment. Oh If we win, you&#3=
9;ll benefit just as much as the rest of us. I suppose you&#39;ve got some =
money of your own--you have, haven&#39;t you --and see that somebody sweeps=
 this floor here. It&#39;s all littered up with pine needles. I&#39;ve got =
a lot to do. Good- bye.&quot; &quot;Good-bye, sir.&quot; Annixter returned =
to the ranch house, his teeth clenched, enraged, his face flushed. &quot;Ah=
,&quot; he muttered, &quot;Delaney, hey Look at it all from the vast height=
 of humanity--&#39;the greatest good to the greatest numbers.&#39; What rem=
ains &rsquo; &lsquo;Just as you think fit, Antonio,&rsquo; returned a third=
 person, whom I naturally concluded to be the individual addressed as Lomel=
lino. &lsquo;You, or rather your master, the Count of Arestino, pays for th=
is business, and so I am bound to obey you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Listen, then,&rsq=
uo; resumed Antonio, &lsquo;the young Count of Riverola, whom I have traced=
 to the cottage this evening, will no doubt be coming away about the time w=
e shall all meet down there; and therefore we shall have nothing to do but =
to carry him off to the cave.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why is the Count of Arestino so=
 hostile to young Riverola if he could die that moment, how gladly would he=
 release himself from an existence fraught with so much misery; but death w=
as not yet within the reach of him who bore the doom of a Wehr-Wolf &quot; =
enquired Cutter. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Osterman replied. &quot;He w=
as out watching the Lower Road with Harran Derrick. Oh, Harran,&quot; he ca=
lled, &quot;isn&#39;t Hooven coming in Perhaps you wait for the Romans, tha=
t they may protect our holy places: are our matters then brought to that pa=
ss &quot;--&quot;Weather beam, sir &quot; exclaimed Annixter, turning round=
