<p><b style="font: 5px Goudy Old Style; color: #6D7B8D;">The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.Having no hair made him look even hairier.She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.I&#39;m confused: when people ask me what&#39;s up, and I point, they groan.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his go.A glittering gem is not enough.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.The mysterious diary records the voice.She always speaks to him in a loud voice.The tortoise jumped into the lake with dreams of becoming a sea turtle.Love is not like pizza.The Tsunami wave crashed against the raised houses and broke the pilings as if they were toothpicks.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the class.Best friends are like old tomatoes and shoelaces.Flying fish flew by the space station.The skeleton had skeletons of his own in the closet.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.Jason didn&rsquo;t understand why his parents wouldn&rsquo;t let him sell his little sister at the garage .They finished building the road they knew no one would ever use.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.The worst thing about being at the top of the career ladder is that there&#39;s a long way to fall.On each full moonNot people who wander are lost.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.Let me help you with your baggage.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this about?</b></p>
