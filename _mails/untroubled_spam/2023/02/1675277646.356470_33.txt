In February 2006, NASA's National Scientific Balloon Facility was renamed the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility.[75] A supercomputer built in 2004 at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division was named "Columbia".[76] The first part of the system, named "Kalpana", was dedicated to Chawla, who had worked at the Ames Research Center before joining the Space Shuttle program.[77] The first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Metsat-1, was renamed to Kalpana-1 on February 5, 2003, after Chawla.[78][79] In 2003, the airport in Amarillo, Texas, where Husband was from, was renamed to the Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport.[80] A mountain peak in the Sangre de Cristo Range in the Colorado Rockies was renamed Columbia Point in 2003.[81] In October 2004, both houses of Congress passed a resolution to change the name of Downey, California's Space Science Learning Center to the Columbia Memorial Space Center, which is located at the former manufacturing site of the Space Shuttle orbiters.[82][83] On April 1, 2003, the Opening Day of baseball season, the Houston Astros honored the Columbia crew by having seven simultaneous first pitches thrown by family and friends of the crew. For the National Anthem, 107 NASA personnel carried a U.S. flag onto the field.[84] The Astros wore the mission patch on their sleeves the entire season.[85] On February 1, 2004, the first anniversary of the Columbia disaster, Super Bowl XXXVIII held in Houston's Reliant Stadium began with a pregame tribute to the crew of the Columbia by singer Josh Groban performing "You Raise Me Up", with the crew of STS-114 in attendance.[86][87] In 2004, two space journalists, Michael Cabbage and William Ha
