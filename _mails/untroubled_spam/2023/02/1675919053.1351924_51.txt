<p><b style="font: 10px Goudy Old Style; color: #3090C7;">It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone whispering into a cell .It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide the way to the deepest depths.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.You have no right to yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a lockpick.Greetings from the galaxy MACS0647-JD, or what we .It&#39;s much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.The tortoise jumped into the lake with dreams of becoming a sea turtle.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best , but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.You&#39;re good at English when you know the difference between a man eating chicken and a man-eating chicken.This book is sure to liquefy your brain.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.She paints with bold colors; she does not like pastels.Pat ordered a ghost pepper pie.I&rsquo;m a living furnace.I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me.wait outside of the house.Mary plays the piano.Hit me with your pet shark!Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this about?I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.Two seats were vacant.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.He had decided to accept his fate of accepting his fate.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.</b></p>
