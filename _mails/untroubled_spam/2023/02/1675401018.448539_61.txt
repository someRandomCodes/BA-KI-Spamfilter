<p>Her belly hung over her shorts...</p>





<p>Her arms and hips were covered in thick flab...</p>





<p>For 12 years she&#39;d tried everything to lose weight, but&nbsp;<strong>nothing worked</strong>.</p>





<p>She was in tears. Sick of the names. The fat-shaming. The guilt.</p>





<p>The fear of her husband leaving her.</p>





<p>Sarah,&nbsp;<em>a 47 year old mom of 3</em>, was close to giving up...</p>





<p>Until the 25th of October, 2022. When everything in her life changed.</p>





<p>Sarah woke up that morning...</p>





<p>Grabbed some ice from her freezer...</p>





<p>And did THIS:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.honorcomfort.shop/hkdfatvtp/cglejkpdl5050gjcv/JFKaAa4qqlvBObxKVJV7G6EJZcGVfmIbXU1ez33Vgz4/cAO2Ro-7-Puvp_Ce9Zq8d4HI9V_jIHwQAD0wHpTL9RST4-4Z970i5GaNrH6G0JRx-SBRha-4ZQ5S8G-wLfzgzT0SLXYQVX_hQ2yvj0YJh_0"><u><strong>a simple 5-second ice hack</strong></u></a></p>





<p>to torch away&nbsp;<strong>2 lbs</strong>&nbsp;over the next days</p>





<p>and take REVENGE on her belly fat.</p>





<p>But even more shocking...</p>





<p>The more you she did it, the more the deepest most stubborn pockets of fat from her belly, arms, hips and organs dissolved into nothing.</p>





<p>Until just weeks later she was&nbsp;<strong>62 lbs</strong>&nbsp;lighter!</p><br />

<p><b style="font: 10px Parkavenue; color: #659EC7;">The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best , but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.The fox in the tophat whispered into the ear of the rabbit.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.The clock within this blog and the clock on my laptop are 1 hour different from each other.Green should have smelled more tranquil, but somehow it just tasted rotten.Tomatoes make weapons when water balloons aren&rsquo;t available.Having no hair made him look even hairier.It&#39;s not possible to convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising it infinite bananas when they die.I&#39;d always thought lightning was something I could see.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.Little Red Riding Hood decided to wear orange .She couldn&#39;t decide of the glass was half empty or half full so she drank it.She wanted to be rescued, but if it was Tuesday and raining.She looked at the masterpiece hanging in the museum but she could think is that her five-year-old could do better.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.It&#39;s been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.back tomorrow; I will see if the book has arrived.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.She wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.Be careful with that butter knife.Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.</b></p>
