<p><b style="font: 9.5px Segoe Script; color: #0041C2;">They wandered into a strange Tiki bar on the edge of the small beach town.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his go.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.I don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July.The random sentence generator generated a random sentence about a random sentence.Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good environment for learning English.The dead trees waited to be ignited by the smallest spark and seek their revenge.Every manager should be able to recite at least ten nursery rhymes backward.We have a lot of rain in June.I used to practice weaving with spaghetti three hours a day but stopped because I didn&#39;t want to die alone.The heatShe opened up her third bottle of wine of the night.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.My secretary is the person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.He ran out of , so he had to playing poker.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.She wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead.It didn&#39;t take long for Gary to detect the robbers were amateurs.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.He was % into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.back tomorrow; I will see if the book has arrived.I&rsquo;m a living furnace.The teens wondered what was kept in the red shed on the far edge of the school grounds.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.</b></p>
