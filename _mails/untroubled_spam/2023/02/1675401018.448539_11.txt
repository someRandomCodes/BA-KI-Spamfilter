<p><span style="font-size:14px;">My friend Sharon just lost 34 pounds, SEVENTEEN of those in the first few weeks... right after she started this simple morning routine...</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Prior to this, nothing worked for her... at best she&#39;d lose weight one week, just to gain it back the next.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:14px;">But when she started&nbsp;doing THIS every morning, things rapidly shifted...</span></p>

<p><b style="font: 9.5px Iskoola Pota; color: #992600;">The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.She wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead.They wandered into a strange Tiki bar on the edge of the small beach town.Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.I caught my squirrel rustling through my gym bag.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.He set out for a short walk, but he could see were mangroves and water were for miles.When he asked her favorite number, she answered without hesitation that it was diamonds.He said he was not there yesterday; however, many people saw him there.waiting for exceptional things to just happen.As he looked out the window, he saw a clown walk by.As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone whispering into a cell .The secret ingredient to his was crime.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.He was % into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.She was too short to see over the fence.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to cigarettes.The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.The manager of the fruit stand always sat and sold vegetables.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.As he looked out the window, he saw a clown walk by.He shaved the peach to prove a point.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.</b></p>
