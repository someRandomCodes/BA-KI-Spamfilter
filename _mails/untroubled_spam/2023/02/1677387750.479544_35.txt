<p>&rdquo; &ldquo;There is such a young man,&rdquo; responded the Turkish messenger; &ldquo;and you will see him presently.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh sail booms. Beside the natural desire to get home, we had another reason for urging the ship on. The scurvy had begun to show itself on board. One man had it so badly as to be disabled and off duty, and the English lad, Ben, was in a dreadful state, and was daily growing worse. His legs swelled and pained him so that he could not walk; his flesh lost its elasticity, so that if it was pressed in, it would not return to its shape; and his gums swelled until he could not open his mouth. His breath, too, became very offensive; he lost all strength and spirit; could eat nothing; grew worse every day; and, in fact, unless something was done for him, would be a dead man in a week, at the rate at which he was sinking. The medicines were all, or nearly all, gone; and if we had had a chest &quot; he asked. Gethings stepped forward and took his place by the driver. The carry boy over at Derrick&#39;s, has just come from the Governor with a message. I guess it&#39;s important.&quot; &quot;Hello, what&#39;s up now of sail, and tearing and slatting itself to pieces. The halyards were at this moment let go by the run; and such a piece of work I never had before, in taking in a sail. After great exertions I got it, or the remains of it, into the top, and was making it fast, when the captain, looking up, called out to me, &quot;Lay aloft there, D like shape; the rich garments which he wears become a rough, shaggy, and wiry skin; his body loses its human contours, his arms and limbs take another form; and, with a frantic howl of misery, to which the woods give horribly faithful reverberations, and, with a rush like a hurling wind, the wretch starts wildly away, no longer a man, but a monstrous wolf &rdquo; said the grand vizier, with rapid and excited utterance. &ldquo;I have no eyes and no ears, great pasha,&rdquo; said the negro, &ldquo;save in respect to those matters which would render you faithless to the sister of the sultan.&rdquo; &ldquo;Would to Heaven that you had neither eyes nor ears at all&mdash;that you did not exist, indeed And now Francisco is the sole guardian of that mystery, which he himself knows not, or at least knew not, when last we were together. But it requires a strong and energetic mind, like my own, to watch over that awful secret. And now, Fernand, dear Fernand, thou canst not blame me, thou wilt not reproach me, if I experience an irresistible longing to return to my native land like, steered for the first grog it will only be a great help to you. It will make you more noble, a truer woman, more generous.&quot; &quot;I think I see,&quot; she answered, &quot;and I never thought about it in that light before.&quot; &quot;I want to help you,&quot; he answered, &quot;as you have helped me. I want to be your friend, and above all things I do not want to see your life wasted. I am going away and it is quite possible I shall never see you again, but you will always be a help to me.&quot; &quot;I do not understand,&quot; she answered, &quot;but I know you mean to be very, very kind to me. Yes, I hope when you come back seven years, and whose character is attested by the acclamation of the people, &quot;Reign as you have lived &quot; said Tom, &quot;you haven&#39;t seen the worst of it yet.&quot; In the midst of this conversation the captain appeared; and we winded the boat round, shoved her down, and prepared to go off. The captain, who had been on the coast before and &quot;knew the ropes,&quot; took the steering oar, and we went off in the same way as the other boat. I, being the youngest, had the pleasure of standing at the bow, and getting wet through. We went off well, though the seas were high. Some of them lifted us up, and sliding from under us, seemed to let us drop through the air like a flat plank upon the body of the water. In a few minutes we were in the low, regular swell, and pulled for a light, which, as we came up, we found had been run up to our trysail gaff. Coming aboard, we hoisted up all the boats, and diving down into the forecastle, changed our wet clothes, and got our supper. After supper the sailors lighted their pipes, (cigars, those of us who had them,) and we had to tell all we had seen ashore. Then followed conjectures about the people ashore, the length of the voyage, carrying hides, etc., until eight bells, when all hands were called aft, and the &quot;anchor watch&quot; set. We were to stand two in a watch, and as the nights were pretty long, two hours were to make a watch. The second mate was to keep the deck until eight o&#39;clock, and all hands were to be called at daybreak, and the word was passed to keep a bright look 7, l. iii. c. 2 to. It was soon ready, the boom topped up, preventer guys rove, and the idlers called up to man the halyards; yet such was still the force of the gale, that we were nearly an hour setting the sail; carried away the outhaul in doing it, and came very near snapping off the swinging boom. No sooner was it set than the ship tore on again like one that was mad, and began to steer as wild as a hawk. The men at the wheel were puffing and blowing at their work, and the helm was going hard up and hard down, constantly. Add to this, the gale did not lessen as the day came on, but the sun rose in clouds. A sudden lurch threw the man from the weather wheel across the deck and against the side. The mate sprang to the wheel, and the man, regaining his feet, seized the spokes, and they hove the wheel up just in time to save her from broaching to; though nearly half the studding &quot; &rdquo; thundered the voice of the forgotten Stephano, and in a moment the bandit flung himself upon Wagner, whom he attempted to hurl into the crystal but deep river. Fernand, however, caught the arm of the brigand and dragged him along with him into the water, while a terrific scream burst from the lips of Nisida. Then furious was the struggle that commenced in the depths of the stream. But Stephano lay beneath Wagner, who held him down on the pebbly bottom. In another moment Nisida herself plunged into the river with the wild hope of aiding her lover to conquer his foe, or to rescue him from the grasp which the bandit maintained upon him with the tenacity that was strengthened rather than impaired by the agony of suffocation. But she rose again to the surface in an instant by the indomitable influence of that instinct for self : He was forbidden to pitch his tents on an eminence because Attila&#39;s were below on the plain. Ibid. + up.&quot; Instantly a white &rdquo; demanded Ibrahim; although, had he not his own purposes to serve, he would never have thought of seeking the abode, nor inquiring after the welfare of the humble acquaintance of his obscure days. The young Greek knew not, however, the thorough selfishness of the renegade&rsquo;s character; and he poured forth his gratitude for the vizier&rsquo;s kindness and condescension with the most sincere and heart &rdquo; Flora entered the little room allotted to her, and the nun retired, simply closing, but not bolting the door behind her. A taper burnt before a crucifix suspended to the wall; and near it hung a scourge, from which last mentioned object Flora averted her eyes with horror. A bed, a simple toilet &quot; said he. &quot;Lay me on, Captain Bunker inspired shepherd of the Hebraic legends, a dweller in the wilderness, gifted with strange powers. He was dressed as when Presley had first met him, herding his sheep, in brown canvas overalls, thrust into top boots; grey flannel shirt, open at the throat, showing the breast ruddy with tan; the waist encircled with a cartridge belt, empty of cartridges. But now, as Presley took more careful note of him, he was surprised to observe a certain new look in Vanamee&#39;s deep &quot; but Annixter took the words out of his mouth. &quot;He says there&#39;s some talk of the railroad selling us their sections this winter.&quot; &quot;Oh, he did, did he State Commerce Commission, the whole matter has become so confused that Vanderbilt himself couldn&#39;t straighten it out. And how can it be expected that railroad commissions who are chosen I went to him and said, &quot;Captain Wilson, I believe.&quot; Yes, that was his name. &quot;I knew you, sir, when you commanded the Ayacucho on this coast, in old hide there it was, his epic, his inspiration, his West, his thundering progression of hexameters. A sudden uplift, a sense of exhilaration, of physical exaltation appeared abruptly to sweep Presley from his feet. As from a point high above the world, he seemed to dominate a universe, a whole order of things. He was dizzied, stunned, stupefied, his morbid supersensitive mind reeling, drunk with the intoxication of mere immensity. Stupendous ideas for which there were no names drove headlong through his brain. Terrible, formless shapes, vague figures, gigantic, monstrous, distorted, whirled at a gallop through his imagination. He started homeward, still in his dream, descending from the hill, emerging from the canyon, and took the short cut straight across the Quien Sabe ranch, leaving Guadalajara far to his left. He tramped steadily on through the wheat stubble, walking fast, his head in a whirl. Never had he so nearly grasped his inspiration as at that moment on the hilltop. Even now, though the sunset was fading, though the wide reach of valley was shut from sight, it still kept him company. Now the details came thronging back myself door, stoked vigorously for a few moments. The indicator of the steam gauge rose; his speed increased; a glance at the telegraph poles told him he was doing his fifty miles an hour. The freight engine behind him was never built for that pace. Barring the terrible risk of accident, his chances were good. But suddenly yes&mdash;I see it all&mdash;my former suspicions are confirmed. Wretched woman. What harm did the unfortunate Agnes do to thee Whither are we bound &rdquo; &ldquo;No harm will befall you, daughter,&rdquo; said the nun, &ldquo;if you manifest contrition for past errors and a resolution to devote your future years to the service of Heaven.&rdquo; &ldquo;My past errors wilt thou refuse to avail thyself of gifts that must render us so supremely happy &quot; &quot;The United States marshal from San Francisco,&quot; explained Magnus, &quot;came down early this morning and stopped at Guadalajara. We learned it all through our friends in Bonneville about an hour ago. They telephoned me and Mr. Broderson. S. Behrman met him and provided about a dozen deputies. Delaney, Ruggles, and Christian joined them at Guadalajara. They left Guadalajara, going towards Mr. Annixter&#39;s ranch house on Quien Sabe. They are serving the writs in ejectment and putting the dummy buyers in possession. They are armed. S.

Behrman with the United States marshal and his posse. The event that had been so long in preparation, the event which it had been said would never come to pass, the last trial of strength, the last fight between the Trust and the People, the direct, brutal grapple of armed men, the law defied, the Government ignored, behold, here it was close at hand. Osterman cocked his revolver, and in the profound silence that had fallen upon the scene, the click was plainly audible from end to end of the line. &quot;Remember our agreement, gentlemen,&quot; cried Magnus, in a warning voice. &quot;Mr. Osterman, I must ask you to let down the hammer of your weapon.&quot; No one answered. In absolute quiet, standing motionless in their places, the Leaguers watched the approach of the marshal. Five minutes passed. The riders came on steadily. They drew nearer. The grind of the buggy wheels in the grit and dust of the road, and the prolonged clatter of the horses&#39; feet began to make itself heard. The Leaguers could distinguish the faces of their enemies. In the buggy were S. Behrman and Cyrus Ruggles, the latter driving. A tall man in a frock coat and slouched hat &quot; were the last words of the despair of Phocas. After suffering each variety of insult and torture, his head was severed from his body, the mangled trunk was cast into the flames, and the same treatment was inflicted on the statues of the vain usurper, and the seditious banner of the green faction. The voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people, invited Heraclius to ascend the throne which he had purified from guilt and ignominy; after some graceful hesitation, he yielded to their entreaties. His coronation was accompanied by that of his wife Eudoxia; and their posterity, till the fourth generation, continued to reign over the empire of the East. The voyage of Heraclius had been easy and prosperous; the tedious march of Nicetas was not accomplished before the decision of the contest: but he submitted without a murmur to the fortune of his friend, and his laudable intentions were rewarded with an equestrian statue, and a daughter of the emperor. It was more difficult to trust the fidelity of Crispus, whose recent services were recompensed by the command of the Cappadocian army. His arrogance soon provoked, and seemed to excuse, the ingratitude of his new sovereign. In the presence of the senate, the son Hand over hand, we hauled the lead in, and the captain, taking it to the light, found black mud on the bottom.

From this salutary slumber the emperor was awakened by the pope Vigilius and the patrician Cethegus, who appeared before his throne, and adjured him, in the name of God and the people, to resume the conquest and deliverance of Italy. In the choice of the generals, caprice, as well as judgment, was shown. A fleet and army sailed for the relief of Sicily, under the conduct of Liberius; but his youth ^ lines before the hatches were opened. The ship being now ready, we covered the bottom of the hold over, fore and aft, with dried brush for dunnage, and having levelled everything away, we were ready to take in our cargo. All the hides that had been collected since the California left the coast, (a little more than two years,) amounting to about forty thousand, were cured, dried, and stowed away in the house, waiting for our good ship to take them to Boston. Now began the operation of taking in our cargo, which kept us hard at work, from the grey of the morning till star &quot; &quot;My place is where I choose is not your holy house gone let them take it all at once; and let their ghosts no longer be disappointed by a few parcels of my bowels offered to them.&quot; As soon as he had said these words, he presently died, when he had reigned no longer than a year.

Then, obedient to the command of the stranger, they slowly quitted the apartment&mdash;urged to yield to his will by a secret influence which they could not resist, but which nevertheless animated them with a pious confidence in the integrity of his purpose. The door closed behind them, and Christian Rosencrux remained in the room with the dead Wagner and the dying Nisida. CHAPTER LXIV. While the incidents related in the last few chapters were taking place at the Riverola Palace, the council of state had assembled to receive the grand vizier, the mighty Ibrahim, who had signified his intention of meeting that august body at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Accordingly, as soon as he had witnessed the marriage ceremony which united his sister to the Count of Riverola, he returned from Wagner&rsquo;s mansion to his own pavilion in the midst of the Ottoman encampment. There he arrayed him in a manner becoming his exalted rank, and mounting his splendid caparisoned steed, he repaired with a brilliant escort to the ducal palace.
