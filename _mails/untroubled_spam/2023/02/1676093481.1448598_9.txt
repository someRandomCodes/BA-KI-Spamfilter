<p><b style="font: 9.5px Bradley Hand; color: #ff0000;">Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.There&#39;s a message for you if you look up.Their argument could be heard across the parking lot.The Great Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.The rusty nail stood erect, angled at a 45-degree angle, just waiting for the perfect barefoot to come along.It isn&#39;t true that my mattress is made of cotton candy.There are no heroes in a punk rock band.Her life in the confines of the house became her new normal.Twin 4-month-olds slept in the shade of the palm tree while the mother tanned in the sun.We have a lot of rain in June.The lake is a long way from here.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should never Nair.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.The best key lime pie is still up for debate.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.She only paints with bold colors; she does not like pastels.Mary plays the piano.It isn&#39;t true that my mattress is made of cotton candy.I often see the time 11:11 or 12:34 on clocks.Jason lived his life by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but only she could make herself happy.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should never Nair.The team members were hard to tell apart since they all wore their hair in a ponytail.Getting up at dawn is for the birds.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.Weather is not trivial - it&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re standing in it.There&#39;s an art to getting your way, and spitting olive pits across the table isn&#39;t it.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Bradley Hand; color: #ff0000;">He was 100% into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.Giving directions that the mountains are to the west only works when you can see them.The manager of the fruit stand always sat and only sold vegetables.She found his complete dullness interesting.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.Now I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realThis is the last random sentence I will be writing and I am going to stop mid-sentThe Japanese yen for commerce is still well-known.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain all of her strangeness.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.She wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead.While all her friends were positive that Mary had a sixth sense, she knew she actually had a seventh sense.The father died during childbirth.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to buy cigarettes.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.He told us a very exciting adventure story.He decided to fake his disappearance to avoid jail.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.He decided to live his life by the big beats manifesto.Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.After fighting off the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.Lucifer was surprised at the amount of life at Death Valley.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.He had a vague sense that trees gave birth to dinosaurs.I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me.She had the gift of being able to paint songs.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.A good example of a useful vegetable is medicinal rhubarb.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Bradley Hand; color: #ff0000;">I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me.They finished building the road they knew no one would ever use.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.After coating myself in vegetable oil I found my success rate skyrocketed.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.This is the last random sentence I will be writing and I am going to stop mid-sentNormal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.The near-death experience brought new ideas to light.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.She was only made the society president because she can whistle with her toes.Cursive writing is the best way to build a race track.He had a wall full of masks so she could wear a different face every day.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.She saw no irony asking me to change but wanting me to accept her for who she is.Best friends are like old tomatoes and shoelaces.They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the lady&rsquo;s bag of food.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.The delicious aroma from the kitchen was ruined by cigarette smoke.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.They finished building the road they knew no one would ever use.He invested some skill points in Charisma and Strength.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Bradley Hand; color: #ff0000;">Mary plays the piano.It took me too long to realize that the ceiling hadn&#39;t been painted to look like the sky.Green should have smelled more tranquil, but somehow it just tasted rotten.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.</b></p>
