<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Hip flexors is the longest muscle in the body and the only muscle that connects the upper body and lower body, also known as the psoas (pronounced so-az).</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Your psoas...</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;stabilize your trunk and spine during movement and sitting</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;allow you to bend your hips and legs towards your chest</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;support your internal organs</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;is connected to your diaphragm which allows you to walk and breathe.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">In other words, your psoas has a direct influence on your fight or flight response!</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If the psoas get tight and weak, it can be a real pain but working certain muscles and doing the certain exercise cobinations provide easy fixes.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">So... If you experience...<br />


low back pain<br />


hip pain<br />


stiffness<br />


pain while walking or moving<br />


trouble sleeping<br />


shortness of breath</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">You need to start undoing some of the damage done to your body and start helping the body to naturally heal itself.</span></p>
