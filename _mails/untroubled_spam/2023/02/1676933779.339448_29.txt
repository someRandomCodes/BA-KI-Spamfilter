st Palestine was founded in 1828 as Mechanicsburg and incorporated as a village in 1875 as East Palestine after the Middle Eastern region of Palestine.[8] The name was changed as part of a religious nomenclature in the area, including communities such as Medina, Enon Valley, New Galilee and Salem; Palestine, Ohio, was already an incorporated community in the western part of the state.[9] Having reached a population of 5,000, East Palestine operated as a statutory city from 1920 until 2011 when it reverted to village status because of declining population. By the 1920s, railroad facilities of the city consisted of the four-track Pennsylvania Railroad system. Switches from the Pittsburgh, Lisbon, and Western Railroad within one mile of the corporation limits connected with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad and New York Central Railroad. The city's leading industries were the manufacture of pottery and automobile tires by the W. S. George Pottery Company and the Edwin C. McGraw Tire Company. However, factories also existed that produced steel tanks, foundry work, electrical refractories, food products, electric wiring devices, wooden ventilators, fireproofing material, synthetic ice, and lumber. Around this time, East Palestine began to start an economy in orcharding, which still survives today. Large storage and preserving facilities made East Palestine the leading city for orchards in the area.[10] East Palestine became a qualified Tree City USA as recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation in 2004.[11] 2023 train derailment Main article: 2023 Ohio train derailment On February 3, 2023, an explosion and fire occurred following the derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train carrying hazardous chemicals on the eastern end of town.[12] A "state of emergency" was declared by the city council on February 4.[13] An evacuation area was extended by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine on February 6 to allow for "a controlled release of vinyl chloride" and burning it in a nearby trench.[14] Some residents subsequently started a class-action lawsuit against Norfo
