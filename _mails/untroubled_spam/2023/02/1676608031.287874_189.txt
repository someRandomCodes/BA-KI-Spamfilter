Did you know that belly fat is worse than smoking 20 cigarettes a day?

The fat that surrounds your organs is slowly choking and suffocating them.

Causing type 2 diabetes....

Increasing the risks of heart disease..

Sexual dysfunction...

And horrible high blood pressure.

Not to mention, it looks pretty awful.

Sorry to be so direct, but sometimes I feel like I have to when it comes to health matters as important as these..

And if you think you have nothing to worry about because you’re on a’ diet’ and you exercise, think again…

Because according to verified independent scientific studies, diets fail on average 95% of the time…

And exercise makes you just want to eat more… and many times eating more calories than what you burn…

Which is exactly what happened to an overweight, on the brink of a heart attack 44-year-old photojournalist…

Who tried every single diet and exercise under the sun to no avail and nearly died while on assignment in the Amazon Rainforest…

But by the grace of God, he would soon stumble upon a 10-second morning release…

That helped him supercharge his metabolism and destroy all his fat cells…

Leading him to lose 74 pounds in mere weeks!

nder chief justices Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth (1789–1801), the court heard few cases; its first decision was West v. Barnes (1791), a case involving procedure.[12] As the court initially had only six members, every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two-thirds (voting four to two).[13] However, Congress has always allowed less than the court's full membership to make decisions, starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789.[14] The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige,[15] a situation not helped by the era's highest-profile case, Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment.[16] The court's power and prestige grew substantially during the Marshall Court (1801–1835).[17] Under Marshall, the court established the power of judicial review over acts of Congress,[18] including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution (Marbury v. Madison)[19][20] and making several important constitutional rulings that gave shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and states, notably Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, McCulloch v. Maryland, and Gibbons v. Ogden.[21][22][23][24] The Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion seriatim,[25] a remnant of British tradition,[26] and instead issuing a single majority opinion.[25] Also during Marshall's tenure, although beyond the court's control, the impeachment and acquittal of Justice Samuel
