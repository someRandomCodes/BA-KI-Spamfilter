<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Have you heard about hip flexors?</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><img src="http://www.stomachretired.shop/mqwchlum/dbuxuumqcxoal/.gif" style="width: 471px; height: 852px;" /></span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Hip flexors is the longest muscle in the body and the only muscle that connects the upper body and lower body, also known as the psoas (pronounced so-az).</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Your psoas...</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;stabilize your trunk and spine during movement and sitting</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;allow you to bend your hips and legs towards your chest</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;support your internal organs</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">&hellip;is connected to your diaphragm which allows you to walk and breathe.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">In other words, your psoas has a direct influence on your fight or flight response!</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If the psoas get tight and weak, it can be a real pain but working certain muscles and doing the certain exercise cobinations provide easy fixes.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:16px;">So... If you experience...<br />


low back pain<br />


hip pain<br />


stiffness<br />


pain while walking or moving<br />


trouble sleeping<br />


shortness of breath</span></p><br />

<p><b style="font: 10px Bodoni MT; color: #1F45FC;">I like to work after my eight-hour tea-break.When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand and I still remember it quite vividly.She was the type of girl that always burnt sugar to show she cared.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.The sky is clear; the stars are twinkling.It was her first experience training a rainbow unicorn.She looked into the mirror and saw another person.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.There&#39;s a reason that roses have thorns.As he looked out the window, he saw a clown walk by.The bird had a belief that it was really a groundhog.He felt that dining on the bridge brought romance to his relationship with his cat.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.Warm beer on a cold day isn&#39;t my idea of fun.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.A quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.He decided to fake his disappearance to jail.I&#39;m not a party animal, but I do like animal parties.I&#39;m not a party animal, but I do like animal parties.Greetings from the real universe.She had some news to share but nobody to share it with.We have a lot of rain in June.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.Having no hair made him look even hairier.The near-death experience brought ew ideas to light.He wasn&#39;t bitter that she had moved on but from the radish.Jason didn&rsquo;t understand why his parents wouldn&rsquo;t let him sell his little sister at the garage .Shakespeare was a famous 17th-century diesel mechanic.Whenever he saw a red flag warning at the beach he grabbed his surfboard.</b></p>
