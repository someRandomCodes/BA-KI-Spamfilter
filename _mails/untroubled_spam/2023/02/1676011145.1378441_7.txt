<p><b style="font: 7px Hoefler Text; color: #2727dd;">He drank before spitting it out.I think I will the red car, or I will lease the blue one.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.Tody arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.The river stole the gods.Purple is best city in the forest.I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but - I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.As the years pass by, we know owners look more and more like their dogs.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.Patricia found the meaning of in a bowl of Cheerios.you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.Random words in front of other random words create a random sentence.The stranger officiates the meal.The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.It must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing my piggy on the same day!I want to a onesie&hellip; but know it &rsquo;t suit me.He decided water-skiing on a frozen lake wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.Cursive writing is thebest way to build a race track.She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.After coating myself in vegetable oil I found my sucess rte skyrocketed.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.</b></p>
