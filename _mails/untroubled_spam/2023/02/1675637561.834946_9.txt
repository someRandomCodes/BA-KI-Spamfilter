<p><b style="font: 9px Aharoni Bold; color: #38ACEC;">Two seats were vacant.I want more detailed information.They got there early, and they got really good seats.I heard something and unmemorable.At lastBest friends are like old tomatoes and shoelaces.The pigs were insulted that they were named hamburgers.He always wore his sunglasses at night.The sky is clear; the stars are twinkling.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.He always wore his sunglasses at night.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.Tuesdays are fre if you bring a gnome costume.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.I knew what hardship looked like until it started raining bowling balls.With a single flip of the coin, his changed forever.When was tight, he&#39;d his lunch from the local wishing well.Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.While her friends were positive that Mary had a sixth sense, she knew she actually had a seventh sense.He always wore his sunglasses at night.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.He didn&rsquo;t want to go to the dentist, yet he went anyway.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Aharoni Bold; color: #38ACEC;">This is a Japanese doll.He had concluded that pigs must be able to fly in Hog Heaven.Nancy thought the way to create a welcoming was to line it with barbed wire.She wasn&#39;t sure whether to be impressed or concerned that he folded underwear in neat little packages.Hit me with your pet shark!I would have gotten the promotion, but my attendance wasn&rsquo;t good enough.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Joyce enjoyed eating pancakes with ketchup.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.It&#39;s much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.The worst thing about being at the top of the career ladder is that there&#39;s a long way to fall.He was so preoccupied with whether or not he could that he failed to to consider if he should.I often see the time 11:11 or 12:34 on clocks.The anaconda was the greatest criminal mastermind in this part of the neighborhood.She always speaks to him in a loud voice.She learned that water bottles are no longer just to hold liquid, but they&#39;re also status symbols.The elderly neighborhood became enraged over the coyotes who had been blamed for the poodle&rsquo;s disappearance.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.waiting for exceptional things to just happen.Be careful with that butter knife.The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.The bees decided to have a mutiny against their queen.I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realI don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.The door slammed on the watermelon.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.A good example of a useful vegetable is medicinal rhubarb.The skeleton had skeletons of his own in the closet.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Aharoni Bold; color: #38ACEC;">The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.He found his art progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.He shaved the peach to prove a point.Dan took the deep dive down the rabbit hole.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.She was too busy always talking about what she wanted to do to actually do any of it.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.Imagine his surprise when he discovered that the safe was full of pudding.He had a vague sense that trees gave birth to dinosaurs.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.When he asked her favorite number, she answered without hesitation that it was diamonds.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.The toy brought back fond memories of being lost in the rain forest.His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.He was % into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.Edith could decide if she should paint her teeth or brush her nails.They called out her time and again, but were met with nothing but silence.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.Harrold felt confident that nobody would ever suspect his spy pigeon.Swim at your own risk was taken as a challenge for the group of Kansas City college students.</b></p>
