<p>up had set loose over all the county. Day after day it was the one topic of conversation, at street corners, at cross language out of which the hieroglyphics developed. You can now read that sentence without much difficulty. ``I believe I saw a giraffe.&#39;&#39; Having invented this system the Egyptians developed it during thousands of years until they could write anything they wanted, and they used these ``canned words&#39;&#39; to send messages to friends, to keep business accounts and to keep a record of the history of their country, that future generations might benefit by the mistakes of the past. THE NILE VALLEY THE BEGINNING OF CIVILISATION IN THE VALLEY OF THE NILE THE history of man is the record of a hungry creature in search of food. Wherever food was plentiful, thither man has travelled to make his home. The fame of the Valley of the Nile must have spread at an early date. From the interior of Africa and from the desert of Arabia and from the western part of Asia people had flocked to Egypt to claim their share of the rich farms. Together these invaders had formed a new race which called itself ``Remi&#39;&#39; or ``the Men&#39;&#39; just as we sometimes call America ``God&#39;s own country.&#39;&#39; They had good reason to be grateful to a Fate which had carried them to this narrow strip of land. In the summer of each year the Nile turned the valley into a shallow lake and when the waters receded all the grainfields and the pastures were covered with several inches of the most fertile clay. In Egypt a kindly river did the work of a million men and made it possible to feed the teeming population of the first large cities of which we have any record. It is true that all the arable land was not in the valley. But a complicated system of small canals and well this must be the gallant&mdash;the paramour of my wife&mdash;the father of the boy on whom the law compelled me to bestow my own name. Such were the ideas that immediately struck me; and I now prepared for vengeance. Margaretha watched my wife narrowly, and on the evening following the one on which the letter had been delivered, Vitangela was seen to secure a heavy bag of gold about her person, and quit the mansion by the secret staircase of her apartment&mdash;that apartment which is now the sleeping spike about his neck. He fell from the starboard futtock shrouds, and not knowing how to swim, and being heavily dressed, with all those things round his neck, he probably sank immediately. We pulled astern, in the direction in which he fell, and though we knew that there was no hope of saving him, yet no one wished to speak of returning, and we rowed about for nearly an hour, without the hope of doing anything, but unwilling to acknowledge to ourselves that we must give him up. At length we turned the boat&#39;s head and made towards the vessel. Death is at all times solemn, but never so much so as at sea. A man dies on shore; his body remains with his friends, and &quot;the mourners go about the streets;&quot; but when a man falls overboard at sea and is lost, there is a suddenness in the event, and a difficulty in realizing it, which give to it an air of awful mystery. A man dies on shore Hardly a man on the sidewalks of the town that day who did not hope for it. As Annixter&#39;s team trotted through the central portion of the town, young Vacca pointed to a denser and larger crowd around the rear entrance of the City Hall. Fully twenty saddle horses were tied to the iron rail underneath the scant, half He would have removed his young wife afar from the scene of temptation&mdash;to a distant estate which he possessed; and there by gentle remonstrances and redoubled attention, he would have sought to bind her to him by the links of gratitude and respect, if not by those of love. But this dream&mdash;so honorable to that old man&rsquo;s heart&mdash;was not to be realized; for scarcely was it conceived, when the discourse of the youthful pair turned upon the diamonds&mdash;those diamonds which he had given her on the bridal day damp roused her; she must make an effort to get through the night. She rallied all her strength, and pausing a moment to shift the weight of her baby to the other arm, once more set off through the night. A little while later she found on the edge of the sidewalk the peeling of a banana. It had been trodden upon and it was muddy, but joyfully she caught it up. &quot;Hilda,&quot; she cried, &quot;wake oop, leedle girl. See, loog den, dere&#39;s somedings to eat. Look den, hey Here &quot; closing apparatus. &quot;Where does this go &rdquo; asked the man thus addressed. &ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Antonio described its situation so clearly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why did he not join us of Oh two light brigantines, covered from the missile weapons of the enemy, and rowed by two thousand of the brave and robust youth of Constantinople. Twenty Lomellino, this is the very lady of whom I spoke to you the other evening lines, and three new topsails, made for the homeward passage round Cape Horn, and which had never been bent, were got up from the sailroom, and under the care of the sailmaker, were fitted for bending, and sent up by the halyards into the tops, and, with stops and frapping lines, were bent to the yards, close Oh, for some helping hand now, oh, for one little mouthful, one little nibble and the running rigging so stiff that we could hardly bend it so as to belay it, or, still worse, take a knot with it; and the sails nearly as stiff as sheet iron. One at a time, (for it was a long piece of work and required many hands,) we furled the courses, mizen topsail, and fore &rdquo; &ldquo;The motive of the grand master was a humane one,&rdquo; observed Ibrahim; &ldquo;he has agreed to capitulate, to put an end to the terrific slaughter that is going on.&rdquo; &ldquo;Doubtless the lord general acts in accordance with the dictates of a matured wisdom What ARE you going to do &quot; repeated Lyman Derrick. &quot;I know him well. Yes, of course, it is,&quot; he continued. &quot;Governor, you must know him. He is one of our representative men. You would enjoy talking to him. He was the head of the big Atlas Iron Works. They have shut down recently, you know. Not failed exactly, but just ceased to be a paying investment, and Cedarquist closed them out. He has other interests, though. He&#39;s a rich man going suit, a sack suit of black, made by a Bonneville tailor. But his hat was gone. There were other hats he might have worn, but because this particular one was lost he fretted about it all through his dressing and then decided to have one more look around the barn for it. For over a quarter of an hour he pottered about the barn, going from stall to stall, rummaging the harness room and feed room, all to no purpose. At last he came out again upon the main floor, definitely giving up the search, looking about him to see if everything was in order. The festoons of Japanese lanterns in and around the, barn were not yet lighted, but some half He still receives his accustomed sacrifices cask, the steward comes up, and picks it all over, and takes out the best pieces, (those that have any fat in them) for the cabin. This was done in both the vessels I was in, and the men said that it was usual in other vessels. Indeed, it is made no secret, but some of the crew are usually called to help in assorting and putting away the pieces. By this arrangement the hard, dry pieces, which the sailors call &quot;old horse,&quot; come to their share. There is a singular piece of rhyme, traditional among sailors, which they say over such pieces of beef. I do not know that it ever appeared in print before. When seated round the kid, if a particularly bad piece is found, one of them takes it up, and addressing it, repeats these lines: &quot;Old horse A gay old grandpa, this. He&#39;d better be thinking of his coffin.&quot; It was almost midnight. The dance drew towards its close in a storm of jubilation. The perspiring musicians toiled like galley slaves; the guests singing as they danced. The group of men reassembled in the harness room. Even Magnus Derrick condescended to enter and drink a toast. Presley and Vanamee, still holding themselves aloof, looked on, Vanamee more and more disgusted. Dabney, standing to one side, overlooked and forgotten, continued to sip steadily at his glass, solemn, reserved. Garnett of the Ruby rancho, Keast from the ranch of the same name, Gethings of the San Pablo, and Chattern of the Bonanza, leaned back in their chairs, their waist &rdquo; he demanded, in a slow and imperious tone. &ldquo;If so, put it to the test, unbelieving mortal that thou art The means day life to sustain him, but that it is very much the same plain, matter &quot; said Presley. &quot;You were sure that there was something a boy who could not be prudential, and who caught at every chance for adventure. As we made the high point off San Diego, Point Loma, we were greeted by the cheering presence of a light &quot; &quot;Oh, rot the rain what awful change is taking place in the form of that doomed being &rdquo; &ldquo;Holy Virgin have mercy upon you, signor &rdquo; But little did that stern, imperious woman know of the desperate characters of those with whom she had now to deal. Ashamed of their momentary hesitation, Stephano and Piero rushed on the abbess and Sister Alba, and dragged them, in spite of their deafening screams, into that fatal cell, where they threw them headlong over the lifeless corpse of their victim. Scarcely, however, had they closed the door on the wretched woman, when the Marquis of Orsini returned; and, too well divining what had passed, he exclaimed, &ldquo;In the name of Heaven, captain Lay out on your oars, and long stroke like nose seemed hooked to meet the chin; the lips were slack, the mouth half &rdquo; How profound then was his astonishment, when Giulia, with the calm and tranquil demeanor which innocence usually wears, but with the least, least curl of the upper lip, as if in haughty triumph, leisurely and deliberately drew the jewel jib cloth or tarpaulin, and these we got out, and gave thorough coatings of oil or tar, and hung upon the stays to dry. Our stout boots, too, we covered over with a thick mixture of melted grease and tar, and hung out to dry. Thus we took advantage of the warm sun and fine weather of the Pacific to prepare for its other face. In the forenoon watches below, our forecastle looked like the workshop of what a sailor is, the M.] After the decease of his father, the inheritance of the Roman world devolved to Justinian II.; and the name of a triumphant lawgiver was dishonored by the vices of a boy, who imitated his namesake only in the expensive luxury of building. His passions were strong; his understanding was feeble; and he was intoxicated with a foolish pride, that his birth had given him the command of millions, of whom the smallest community would not have chosen him for their local magistrate. His favorite ministers were two beings the least susceptible of human sympathy, a eunuch and a monk: to the one he abandoned the palace, to the other the finances; the former corrected the emperor&#39;s mother with a scourge, the latter suspended the insolvent tributaries, with their heads downwards, over a slow and smoky fire. Since the days of Commodus and Caracalla, the cruelty of the Roman princes had most commonly been the effect of their fear; but Justinian, who possessed some vigor of character, enjoyed the sufferings, and braved the revenge, of his subjects, about ten years, till the measure was full, of his crimes and of their patience. In a dark dungeon, Leontius, a general of reputation, had groaned above three years, with some of the noblest and most deserving of the patricians: he was suddenly drawn forth to assume the government of Greece; and this promotion of an injured man was a mark of the contempt rather than of the confidence of his prince. As he was followed to the port by the kind offices of his friends, Leontius observed, with a sigh, that he was a victim adorned for sacrifice, and that inevitable death would pursue his footsteps. They ventured to reply, that glory and empire might be the recompense of a generous resolution; that every order of men abhorred the reign of a monster; and that the hands of two hundred thousand patriots expected only the voice of a leader. The night was chosen for their deliverance; and in the first effort of the conspirators, the praefect was slain, and the prisons were forced open: the emissaries of Leontius proclaimed in every street, &quot;Christians, to St. Sophia files, and Harran&#39;s typewriting machine. A great map of Los Muertos with every water joy Hear the P. and S. W. talking about fairness and discrimination. That&#39;s good, that is. Well, I got furious. I was a fool, I suppose. I told them that, in justice to myself, I wouldn&#39;t do first my dearest Gelimer, are you not already the worst of slaves, the slave of the vile nation of the Moors hearted and handsome husband. &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; resumed Nisida, after a short pause, during which she gave way to all the luxury of those sweet and holy reflections which the present scene engendered: and these were the happiest moments of the lady&rsquo;s stormy life. &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;and let me enter upon and make an end of my explanations as speedily as possible. And first, Francisco, relative to our sainted&mdash;our innocent&mdash;our deeply to like triumph filled my soul; and I experienced no remorse for the deed I had done two years, has never granted a similar indulgence; and many of his subjects have renounced the possession of those lands whose value is insufficient to satisfy the demands of the treasury. To the cities which had suffered by hostile inroads Anastasius promised a general exemption of seven years: the provinces of Justinian have been ravaged by the Persians and Arabs, the Huns and Sclavonians; but his vain and ridiculous dispensation of a single year has been confined to those places which were actually taken by the enemy.&quot; Such is the language of the secret historian, who expressly denies that any indulgence was granted to Palestine after the revolt of the Samaritans; a false and odious charge, confuted by the authentic record which attests a relief of thirteen centenaries of gold (fifty S. Behrman block, we took the strain from the other earings, and passing the close crushingly tedious was that mode of existence;&mdash;and the first bright day of real happiness which I enjoyed, was that when I first knew that thou didst love me ovens, when dockworkers and stevedores were thrown out of employment, then there were grumblings and there was a demand that the popular assembly be called together as in the olden days when Carthage had been a self &quot; down the hatch &rdquo; exclaimed the Jew, suddenly recovering his speech, as that dreadful mandate warned him that he would now require all his energy&mdash;all his presence of mind:&mdash;&ldquo;monster mast merciful Heaven, can no prayer, no self and now,&quot; he exclaimed, as a sudden fancied qualm arose in his stomach, &quot;now, it&#39;s all made me sick. Might have known it. Oh, it only lacked that to wind up the whole day. Let her go, I don&#39;t care, and the sooner the better.&quot; He countermanded the supper and went to bed before it was dark, lighting his lamp, on the chair near the head of the bed, and opening his &quot;Copperfield&quot; at the place marked by the strip of paper torn from the bag of prunes. For upward of an hour he read the novel, methodically swallowing one prune every time he reached the bottom of a page. About nine o&#39;clock he blew out the lamp and, punching up his pillow, settled himself for the night. Then, as his mind relaxed in that strange, hypnotic condition that comes just before sleep, a series of pictures of the day&#39;s doings passed before his imagination like the roll of a kinetoscope. First, it was Hilma Tree, as he had seen her in the dairy rate case. Ulsteen decided against me, and now I hear rumours to the effect that rates for the hauling of grain are to be advanced.&quot; When Magnus had finished, there was a moment&#39;s silence, each member of the group maintaining his attitude of attention and interest. It was Harran who first spoke. &quot;S. Behrman manipulated the whole affair. There&#39;s a big deal of some kind in the air, and if there is, we all know who is back of it; S. Behrman, of course, but who&#39;s back of him laid and splendid plan for the regeneration of the empire. It was necessary for the wise and benevolent schemes of the father of his people to lop off those limbs which were infected with irremediable pestilence looking place we were in was the best place on the whole coast for hides. It was the only port for a distance of eighty miles, and about thirty miles in the interior was a fine plane country, filled with herds of cattle, in the centre of which was the Pueblo de los Angelos &rdquo; &ldquo;Liar blue, silk suspenders. It ought to be a strap and a nail.&quot; &quot;Old fool,&quot; observed Annixter, whose repartee was the heaving of brick bats. &quot;Say,&quot; he continued, holding the razor from his face, and jerking his head over his shoulder, while he looked at Presley&#39;s reflection in his mirror; &quot;say, look around. Isn&#39;t this a nifty little room In a moment of despair, Angelus defended his life and liberty, slew the executioner, and fled to the church of St. Sophia. The sanctuary was insensibly filled with a curious and mournful crowd, who, in his fate, prognosticated their own. But their lamentations were soon turned to curses, and their curses to threats: they dared to ask, &quot;Why do we fear closing apparatus involved themselves in a long argument, gazing intently at the top panel of the door. The man who had come to fix the apparatus was unwilling to guarantee it, unless a sign was put on the outside of the door, warning incomers that the door was self riding over east of Four, at the head waters of Mission Creek.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll try for him there, at all events,&quot; answered Presley. &quot;If you see Harran when he comes in, tell him I may not be back in time for supper.&quot; Presley found the pony in the corral, cinched the saddle upon him, and went off over the Lower Road, going eastward at a brisk canter. At Hooven&#39;s he called a &quot;How do you do&quot; to Minna, whom he saw lying in a slat hammock under the mammoth live oak, her foot in bandages; and then galloped on over the bridge across the irrigating ditch, wondering vaguely what would become of such a pretty girl as Minna, and if in the end she would marry the Portuguese foreman in charge of the ditching head, the fasts just ready to be cast off, and everything in the hurry and confusion of departure, so that he was hardly noticed; and the few who did inquire about the matter were told that it was merely a boy who had spent his advance and tried to run away. Had the owners of the vessel known anything of the matter, they would have interfered at once; but they either knew nothing of it, or heard, like the rest, that it was only an unruly boy who was sick of his bargain. As soon as the boy found himself actually at sea, and upon a voyage of two or three years in length, his spirits failed him; he refused to work, and became so miserable, that Captain Arthur took him into the cabin, where he assisted the steward, and occasionally pulled and hauled about decks. He was in this capacity when we saw him; and though it was much better for him than the life in the forecastle, and the hard work, watching, and exposure, which his delicate frame could not have borne, yet, to be joined with a black fellow in waiting upon a man whom he probably looked upon as but little, in point of education and manners, above one of his father&#39;s servants, was almost too much for his spirit to bear. Had he entered upon his situation of his own free will, he could have endured it; but to have been deceived, and, in addition to that, forced into it, was intolerable. He made every effort to go home in our ship, but his captain refused to part with him except in the way of exchange, and that he could not effect. If this account of the whole matter, which we had from the boy, and which was confirmed by all the crew, be correct, I cannot understand why Captain Arthur should have refused to let him go, especially being a captain who had the name, not only with that crew, but with all whom he had ever commanded, of an unusually kind four hours. What was the matter with these women, always set upon this marrying notion it fell calm; once or twice a round copper ball showed itself for a few moments in the place where the sun ought to have been; and a puff or two came from the westward, giving some hope that a fair wind had come at last. During the first two days, we made sail for these puffs, shaking the reefs out of the topsails and boarding the tacks of the courses; but finding that it only made work for us when the gale set in again, it was soon given up, and we lay gallant yard dwellers. The foundation for a new era was laid but yesterday. The human race was given its first chance to become truly civilised when it took courage to question all things and made ``knowledge and understanding&#39;&#39; the foundation upon which to create a more reasonable and sensible society of human beings. The Great War was the ``growing class professional men who used the hungry multitude as an efficient ally in their warfare upon the king and his court. But the fundamental ideas which caused the revolution were invented by a few brilliant minds, and they were at first introduced into the charming drawing If this is a lie, let him deny it. Let HIM DISPROVE the charge.&quot; &quot;Derrick, Derrick,&quot; thundered the Opera House. Keast wheeled about. Where was Magnus portraits of Marshall, Taney, Field, and a coloured lithograph &rdquo; &ldquo;In a few moments you shall know more ordered expression of human energy and purpose. Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past, which surrounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face the problems of the future when we had gone back to our daily tasks. History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy task to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the benefit of the full view. There is no elevator, but young feet are strong and it can be done. Here I give you the key that will open the door. When you return, you too will understand the reason for my enthusiasm. HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON. CONTENTS 1. THE SETTING OF THE STAGE 2.
