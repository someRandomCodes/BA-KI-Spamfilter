<p><b style="font: 8px Aldhabi; color: #1F45FC;">Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.Flying fish flew by the space station.The mysterious diary records the voice.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.They say people remember important moments in their well, yet no one even remembers their own birth.My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes the same things that I do.The urgnt care center was flooded with patients after the news of a ne deadly virus was made public.The pigs were insulted that they were named hamburgers.Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good environment for learning English.It took me too long to realize that the ceiling hadn&#39;t been painted to look like the sky.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.Nothing is as cautiously cuddly as a pet porcupine.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but she could make herself happy.The family&rsquo;s excitement over going to Disneyland was crazier than she anticipated.They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the lady&rsquo;s bag of food.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy everyone.She discovered van is difficult with 2 cats and a dog.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to milk.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.I honestly find her about as intimidating as a basket of kittens.Tuesdays are fre if you bring a gnome costume.</b></p>
