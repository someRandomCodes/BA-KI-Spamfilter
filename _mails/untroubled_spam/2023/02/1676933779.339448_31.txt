rity footage from a business in Salem, Ohio (20 miles [32 km] from East Palestine), and a Ring doorbell camera from New Waterford, Ohio (4 miles [6 km] from East Palestine), show fire emanating from underneath a rail car.[19][20][21] After this, at around 8:55 pm EST on February 3, 2023, approximately 50 cars derailed in East Palestine, a village near the Ohio–Pennsylvania border with a population of 4,800. Fifty cars derailed on the east side of town, near the border with Pennsylvania, and a conflagration ignited.[22] Of the 50 derailed cars, ten contained hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, benzene residue, and butyl acrylate.[23][24] The fire continued to burn for several days after the derailment.[25] About 48 hours later, the NTSB released preliminary findings indicating that the derailment was caused by a mechanical issue on one of the railcars' trucks,[26][5] which may be connected to reports that an axle was observed throwing sparks about an hour before.[27] The crew received an alarm from a wayside defect detector shortly before the derailment indicating a mechanical issue, and then an emergency brake application initiated.[28] Emergency response and burn off Smoke from the accident as seen during the night Video of smoke and fire Nearly 70 emergency agencies from Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania mobilized in response.[29] East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway declared a state of emergency.[30] Norfolk Southern personnel were first to respond on February 3.[31] On February 4, they noticed water spillage into Sulphur Run and Leslie Run and installed booms and underflow dams to separate the floating pollutant.

About 48 hours later, the NTSB released preliminary findings indicating tha=
t the derailment was caused by a mechanical issue on one of the railcars' t=
rucks,[26][5] which may be connected to reports that an axle was observed t=
hrowing sparks about an hour before.[27] The crew received an alarm from a =
wayside defect detector shortly before the derailment indicating a mechanic=
