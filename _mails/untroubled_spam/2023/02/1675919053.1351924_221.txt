Whether you believe in God or not, this is a "must-read" message!!!
All t=
hroughout time, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to=
 this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Did you know=
 that the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?
In the b=
ook of Revelation 13:16-18, we read,
"He (the false prophet who deceives =
many by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and great,=
 rich and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or =
on their foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who has th=
e mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wis=
dom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for=
 it is the number of a man: His number is 666."
Speaking to the last gene=
ration, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelatio=
n 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark of=
 the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell with=
 one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scripture =
that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!
These verses could not be =
referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture references two physi=
cal locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be on on=
e "OR" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it would indicate bo=
th places, not one OR the
other.
This is where it really starts to come=
 together. It is shocking how
accurate the Bible is concerning the implan=
table RFID microchip. These
are notes from a man named Carl Sanders who w=
orked with a team of
engineers to help develop this RFID chip
"Carl San=
ders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
heads-of-state offici=
als such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to discuss plans =
on how to bring about this one-world system.
The government commissioned =
Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and controlling the pe=
oples of the world=E2=80=94a microchip
that could be inserted under the s=
kin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient method that would be gr=
adually accepted by society).
Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behi=
nd him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dollars, took on this proj=
ect and designed a
microchip that is powered by a lithium battery, rechar=
geable through
the temperature changes in our skin. Without the knowledge=
 of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the time), these
=
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing research on the
best=
 and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.
Guess what? Th=
ese researchers found that the forehead and the back of
the hand (the two=
 places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just
the most convenient=
 places, but are also the only viable places for
rapid, consistent temper=
ature changes in the skin to recharge the
lithium battery. The microchip =
is approximately seven millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters in diameter=
, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is capable of storing pages upon =
pages of information about
you. All your general history, work history, c=
riminal record, health
history, and financial data can be stored on this =
chip.
Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he regretfully=

helped design, is the =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D spoken about in Revelation=

13:16=E2=80=9318. The original Greek word for =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D is =
=E2=80=9Ccharagma,=E2=80=9D
which means a =E2=80=9Cscratch or etching.=
=E2=80=9D It is also interesting to note
that the number 666 is actually =
a word in the original Greek. The word
is =E2=80=9Cchi xi stigma,=
=E2=80=9D with the last part, =E2=80=9Cstigma,=E2=80=9D also meaning
=
=E2=80=9Cto stick or prick.=E2=80=9D Carl believes this is referring to a=

hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to inject the
microchip=
."
Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen if the lithium contained=

within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by
=
saying a terrible sore would appear in that location. This is what the
bo=
ok of Revelation says:
"And the first (angel) went, and poured out his vi=
al on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men wh=
ich had the mark
of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image" (R=
evelation
16:2).
You can read more about it here--and to also understan=
d the mystery
behind the number 666: TRUTHBIBLE.US
[http://edu-florida.=

197a424fca41b4b7c75ff52190]
The third angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-=
11 states,
"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, '=
If
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his=

forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
th=
e wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of
His ind=
ignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence o=
f the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their=
 torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, wh=
o worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his n=
ame.'"
"The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to th=
e
working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with
=
all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not
re=
ceive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this
reaso=
n God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe
the lie, t=
hat they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth
but had pleas=
ure in unrighteousness." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)"
Who is Barack Obama, a=
nd why is he still in the public scene?
So what about his name? The meani=
ng of someone's name can say a lot
about a person. God throughout history=
 has given names to people that
have a specific meaning tied to their liv=
es. How about the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hi=
ding beneath the surface.
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall =
like lightning from
heaven."
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "light=
ning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q"
(baw-rawk)
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, w=
e read about Lucifer (Satan) saying
in his heart:
"I will ascend above =
the heights of the clouds, I will be like the
Most High."
In the verses=
 in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him =
falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights =
or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116:
"bamah"--Pronounced (bam-maw=
')
In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U"=

or "O," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts
tog=
ether. So to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a=
 high place like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter "U=
" or "O" would be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U"
Bam-Maw in Heb=
rew poetry similar to the style written in Isaiah, would
translate litera=
lly to "Lightning from the heights." The word "Satan"
in Hebrew is a dire=
ct translation, therefore "Satan."
So when Jesus told His disciples in Lu=
ke 10:18 that He beheld Satan
fall like lightning from heaven, if this we=
re to be spoken by a Jewish
Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the b=
ook of Isaiah, he would
say these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in =
Luke 10:18 as, and I
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.
The names of both of=
 Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names=
 backward (the devil does things in reverse)
we would get "ailam ahsatan"=
. Now if we remove the letters that spell
"Alah" (Allah being the false g=
od of Islam), we get "I am Satan".
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Obama=
's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the we=
st, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In
Islam, they h=
ave their own messiah that they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or =
the Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this=
 man's appearance is the sun rising in the
west.
"Then I saw another an=
gel flying in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preac=
h to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to
every nation, tribe, tongue,=
 and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory t=
o Him, for the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made he=
aven and earth, the sea and springs
of water.'" (Revelation 14:6-7)
Why=
 have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, buri=
al, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000
languages, and noth=
ing comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit =
of God (YHVH) who created all people likewise
transcends all people; ther=
efore the power of His Word is not limited
by people; while all other rel=
igions are man-made, therefore they tend
to primarily stay within their o=
wn culture. The same God who speaks to
all people through His creation of=
 the heavens and earth that draws
all people around the world likewise ha=
s sent His Word to the ends of
the earth so that we may come to personall=
y know Him to be saved in
spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Chris=
t.
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh=

the scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good
t=
han bad in this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court =
of law? Bearing the image of God, is this how we project this
image into =
reality?
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being =
guilty
of a crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, =
but
rather by the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,
c=
reated in God's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a
perfect=
, righteous, and Holy God?
God has brought down His moral laws through th=
e 10 commandments given
to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given =
so we may be
justified, but rather that we may see the need for a savior.=
 They are
the mirror of God's character of what He has written in our hea=
rts,
with our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is wrong to=

steal, lie, dishonor our parents, murder, and so forth.
We can try and=
 follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we
will never catch up=
 to them to be justified before a Holy God. That
same word of the law giv=
en to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Jesus Chris=
t. He came to be our justification by
fulfilling the law, living a sinles=
s perfect life that only God could
fulfill.
The gap between us and the =
law can never be reconciled by our own
merit, but the arm of Jesus is str=
etched out by the grace and mercy of
God. And if we are to grab on, throu=
gh faith in Him, He will pull us
up being the one to justify us. As in th=
e court of law, if someone
steps in and pays our fine, even though we are=
 guilty, the judge can
do what is legal and just and let us go free. That=
 is what Jesus did
almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It was a legal tr=
ansaction being
fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shedding of His b=
lood with His
last word's on the cross crying out, "It is finished!" (Joh=
n 19:30).
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 1=
8:23).
This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming
=
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it
pleas=
ed God to crush His only begotten Son.
This is because the wrath that we =
deserve was justified by being
poured out upon His Son. If that wrath was=
 poured out on us, we would
all perish to hell forever. God created a way=
 of escape by pouring it
out on His Son whose soul could not be left in H=
ades but was raised
and seated at the right hand of God in power.
So no=
w when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God
no longe=
r sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the
glorious image o=
f His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if
we received the wra=
th we deserve, making a way of escape from the
curse of death; now being =
conformed into the image of the heavenly man
walking in a new nature, and=
 no longer in the image of the fallen man
Adam.
Now what we must do is =
repent and put our trust and faith in the
savior, confessing and forsakin=
g our sins, and to receive His Holy
Spirit that we may be born again (for=
 Jesus says we must be born again
to see and enter the Kingdom of God in =
John chapter 3). This is not
just head knowledge of believing in Jesus, b=
ut rather receiving His
words, taking them to heart, so that we may truly=
 be transformed into
the image of God. Where we no longer live to practic=
e sin, but rather
turn from our sins and practice righteousness through f=
aith in Him in
obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.
Our works ca=
nnot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we
earn our way int=
o everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus
Christ:
Jesus says,=

=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shal=
l enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in h=
eaven.
Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not =
prophesied
in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wond=
ers in
Your name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I ne=
ver knew you;
depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Mat=
thew 7:21-23)
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal=
 salvation
to all who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)
"Now I saw a new heaven =
and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away=
. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusa=
lem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for =
her husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the ta=
bernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall =
be His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God wi=
ll wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, no=
r sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things =
have passed away.'
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make al=
l things new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and fa=
ithful.'
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, th=
e
Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
li=
fe freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, =
and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelievi=
ng, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and al=
l liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and brims=
tone, which is the second death.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8)

ke a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."=
<br />
<br />
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q" (baw-r=
awk)<br />
<br />
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying in his=
 heart:<br />
<br />
"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most Hig=
h."<br />
<br />
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times it me=
ntions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew word for the=
 heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116: "bamah"--Pronounced (=
bam-maw')<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U" or "O=
," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts together. So =
to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq) and a high place =
like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the letter "U" or "O" would=
 be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U" Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry simil=
ar to the style written in Isaiah, would translate literally to "Lightning =
from the heights." The word "Satan" in Hebrew is a direct translation, ther=
efore "Satan."<br />
<br />
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan fall li=
ke lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish Rabbi today=
 influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would say these words i=
n Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I saw Satan as Baraq O B=
am-Maw.<br />
<br />
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we were to=
 write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse) we would get=
 "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah bei=
ng the false god of Islam), we get "I am Satan". Coincidence? I don't think=
 so.<br />
<br />
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon in the=
 west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In Islam, they =
have their own messiah that they are waiting for called the 12th Imam, or t=
he Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one prophecy concerning this ma=
n's appearance is the sun rising in the west.<br />
<br />
"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlas=
ting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to every nati=
on, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God =
and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship H=
im who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.'" (Revelation 1=
4:6-7)<br />
<br />
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His death, bur=
ial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000 languages, and nothi=
ng comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)? Because the same Spirit of =
God (YHVH) who created all people likewise transcends all people; therefore=
 the power of His Word is not limited by people; while all other religions =
are man-made, therefore they tend to primarily stay within their own cultur=
e. The same God who speaks to all people through His creation of the heaven=
s and earth that draws all people around the world likewise has sent His Wo=
rd to the ends of the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to b=
e saved in spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh the =
scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good than bad i=
n this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a court of law? Bea=
ring the image of God, is this how we project this image into reality?<br /=
>
<br />
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty of a=
 crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but rather by=
 the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's i=
mage, pose this type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Ho=
ly God?<br />
<br />
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given to Mo=
ses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be justified, but rat=
her that we may see the need for a savior. They are the mirror of God's cha=
racter of what He has written in our hearts, with our conscious bearing wit=
ness that we know that it is wrong to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, mur=
der, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we will ne=
ver catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That same word of t=
he law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago in the body of Jes=
us Christ. He came to be our justification by fulfilling the law, living a =
sinless perfect life that only God could fulfill.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own merit, bu=
t the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. And if w=
e are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us up being the one to=
 justify us. As in the court of law, if someone steps in and pays our fine,=
 even though we are guilty, the judge can do what is legal and just and let=
 us go free. That is what Jesus did almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It=
 was a legal transaction being fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shed=
ding of His blood with His last word's on the cross crying out, "It is fini=
shed!" (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). This =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to crush Hi=
s only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would all perish to h=
ell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it out on His Son whose=
 soul could not be left in Hades but was raised and seated at the right han=
d of God in power.<br />
<br />
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God no lo=
nger sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image =
of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if we received the wrat=
h we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death; now being con=
formed into the image of the heavenly man walking in a new nature, and no l=
onger in the image of the fallen man Adam.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the savior, co=
nfessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy Spirit that we may=
 be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again to see and enter the K=
ingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not just head knowledge of believ=
ing in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart, so that=
 we may truly be transformed into the image of God. Where we no longer live=
 to practice sin, but rather turn from our sins and practice righteousness =
through faith in Him in obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.<br />
<br />
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we earn o=
ur way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus Christ:<br />
<br />
Jesus says,<br />
<br />
=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall e=
nter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven=
. Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophes=
ied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Yo=
ur name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew yo=
u; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)=
<br />
<br />
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to al=
l who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8)<grammarly-desktop-integration data-grammarl=
