<p><b style="font: 9px New Century Schoolbook; color: #737CA1;">The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.I&#39;m a great listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and all that, but I hate people.The Great Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.She discovered van life is difficult with 2 cats and a dog.She was too short to see over the fence.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.We need to rent a room for our party.As the rental car rolled to a stop on the dark road, her fear increased by the moment.All they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe.She let the balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.This is the last random sentence I will be writing and I am going to stop mid-sentMary plays the piano.She borrowed the book from him many years ago and hasn&#39;t yet returned it.There can never be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.Her life in the confines of the house became her new normal.It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but only she could make herself happy.Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.The wooden spoon couldn&rsquo;t cut but left emotional scars.This is a Japanese doll.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.There are few things better in life than a slice of pie.The sky is clear; the stars are twinkling.Weather is not trivial - it&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re standing in it.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of all minerals.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px New Century Schoolbook; color: #737CA1;">There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.The elderly neighborhood became enraged over the coyotes who had been blamed for the poodle&rsquo;s disappearance.The manager of the fruit stand always sat and only sold vegetables.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.She opened up her third bottle of wine of the night.You should never take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.Karen realized the only way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.Today arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.I am never at home on Sundays.Beach-combing replaced wine tasting as his new obsession.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.A kangaroo is really just a rabbit on steroids.The bird had a belief that it was really a groundhog.The team members were hard to tell apart since they all wore their hair in a ponytail.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.He waited for the stop sign to turn to a go sign.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.He ended up burning his fingers poking someone else&#39;s fire.He had a vague sense that trees gave birth to dinosaurs.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes all the same things that I do.A good example of a useful vegetable is medicinal rhubarb.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px New Century Schoolbook; color: #737CA1;">He figured a few sticks of dynamite were easier than a fishing pole to catch fish.Shakespeare was a famous 17th-century diesel mechanic.It&#39;s much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.There can never be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.He dreamed of leaving his law firm to open a portable dog wash.She was too short to see over the fence.It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but only she could make herself happy.The mysterious diary records the voice.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.It must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.Courage and stupidity were all he had.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.The water flowing down the river didn&rsquo;t look that powerful from the carA dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.He liked to play with words in the bathtub.The knives were out and she was sharpening hers.Potato wedges probably are not best for relationships.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.Giving directions that the mountains are to the west only works when you can see them.He loved eating his bananas in hot dog buns.Warm beer on a cold day isn&#39;t my idea of fun.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.Love is not like pizza.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px New Century Schoolbook; color: #737CA1;">Just go ahead and press that button.She found it strange that people use their cellphones to actually talk to one another.As he dangled from the rope deep inside the crevasseA suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.</b></p>
