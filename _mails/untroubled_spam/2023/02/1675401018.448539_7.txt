<p><b style="font: 8px DilleniaUPC; color: #992600;">To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn&#39;t quite go as expected.The virus had powers none of us knew existed.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.He put heat on the wound to see what would grow.I&#39;d always thought lightning was something I could see.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.Fluffy pink unicorns are a popular status symbol among macho men.Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.Mom didn&rsquo;t understand why no one else wanted a hot tub full of jello.You have no right to yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a lockpick.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.is the day I&#39;ll finally know what brick tastes like.He drank before spitting it out.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.I am my aunt&#39;s sister&#39;s daughter.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have to go to the store.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.They throw cabbage that turns your brain into emotional baggage.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.Be careful with that butter knife.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.He had reached the point where he was paranoid about being paranoid.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.The two walked down the slot canyon oblivious to the sound of thunder in the distance.</b></p>
