Whether or not you believe in God, this message is a "must-read"!!!
Throu=
ghout history, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to =
this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Did you know =
that the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?
In the bo=
ok of Revelation 13:16-18, we read,
"He (the false prophet who deceives m=
any by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and great, =
rich and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or o=
n their foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the=
 mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisd=
om. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for =
it is the number of a man: His number is 666."
Referring to the last gene=
ration, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelatio=
n 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark of=
 the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell with=
 one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scripture =
that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!
These verses could not be =
referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture references two physi=
cal locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be on on=
e "OR" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it would indicate bo=
th places, not one OR the
other.
This is where it really starts to come=
 together. It is shocking how
accurate the Bible is concerning the implan=
table RFID microchip. These
are notes from a man named Carl Sanders who w=
orked with a team of
engineers to help develop this RFID chip
"Carl San=
ders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
heads-of-state offici=
als such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to discuss plans =
on how to bring about this one-world system.
The government commissioned =
Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and controlling the pe=
oples of the world=E2=80=94a microchip
that could be inserted under the s=
kin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient method that would be gr=
adually accepted by society).
Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behi=
nd him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dollars, took on this proj=
ect and designed a
microchip that is powered by a lithium battery, rechar=
geable through
the temperature changes in our skin. Without the knowledge=
 of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the time), these
=
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing research on the
best=
 and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.
Guess what? Th=
ese researchers found that the forehead and the back of
the hand (the two=
 places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just
the most convenient=
 places, but are also the only viable places for
rapid, consistent temper=
ature changes in the skin to recharge the
lithium battery. The microchip =
is approximately seven millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters in diameter=
, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is capable of storing pages upon =
pages of information about
you. All your general history, work history, c=
riminal record, health
history, and financial data can be stored on this =
chip.
Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he regretfully=

helped design, is the =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D spoken about in Revelation=

13:16=E2=80=9318. The original Greek word for =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D is =
=E2=80=9Ccharagma,=E2=80=9D
which means a =E2=80=9Cscratch or etching.=
=E2=80=9D It is also interesting to note
that the number 666 is actually =
a word in the original Greek. The word
is =E2=80=9Cchi xi stigma,=
=E2=80=9D with the last part, =E2=80=9Cstigma,=E2=80=9D also meaning
=
=E2=80=9Cto stick or prick.=E2=80=9D Carl believes this is referring to a=

hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to inject the
microchip=
."
Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen if the lithium contained=

within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by
=
saying a terrible sore would appear in that location. This is what the
bo=
ok of Revelation says:
"And the first (angel) went, and poured out his vi=
al on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men wh=
ich had the mark
of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image" (R=
evelation
16:2).
You can read more about it here--and to also understan=
d the mystery
behind the number 666: TRUTHBIBLE.US

11ed30928ffef5ea406173280]
The third angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-1=
1 states,
"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'I=
f
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his=

forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
th=
e wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of
His ind=
ignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence o=
f the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their=
 torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, wh=
o worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his n=
ame.'"
"The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to th=
e
working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with
=
all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not
re=
ceive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this
reaso=
n God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe
the lie, t=
hat they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth
but had pleas=
ure in unrighteousness." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)"
Who is Barack Obama, a=
nd why is he still around?
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone'=
s name can say a lot
about a person. God throughout history has given nam=
es to people that
have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about =
the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath t=
he surface.
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning=
 from
heaven."
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=
=CC=82ra=CC=82q"
(baw-rawk)
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read abo=
ut Lucifer (Satan) saying
in his heart:
"I will ascend above the height=
s of the clouds, I will be like the
Most High."
In the verses in Isaiah=
 that refer directly to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him falling fr=
om the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights or heavens=
 used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116:
"bamah"--Pronounced (bam-maw')
In He=
brew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U"
or "O," =
and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts
together. So t=
o join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a high place=
 like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter "U" or "O" wo=
uld be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U"
Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry =
similar to the style written in Isaiah, would
translate literally to "Lig=
htning from the heights." The word "Satan"
in Hebrew is a direct translat=
ion, therefore "Satan."
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 th=
at He beheld Satan
fall like lightning from heaven, if this were to be sp=
oken by a Jewish
Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the book of Isai=
ah, he would
say these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 =
as, and I
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.
The names of both of Obama's da=
ughters are Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backward (=
the devil does things in reverse)
we would get "ailam ahsatan". Now if we=
 remove the letters that spell
"Alah" (Allah being the false god of Islam=
), we get "I am Satan".
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Obama's campaign=
 logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the west, with th=
e landscape as the flag of the United States. In
Islam, they have their o=
wn messiah that they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (=
the Antichrist of the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this man's appe=
arance is the sun rising in the
west.
"Then I saw another angel flying =
in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach to those =
who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people=
=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory to Him, for =
the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and ea=
rth, the sea and springs
of water.'" (Revelation 14:6-7)
Why have the w=
ords of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, burial, and res=
urrection, been translated into over 3,000
languages, and nothing comes c=
lose (the Quran about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit of God (YHV=
H) who created all people likewise
transcends all people; therefore the p=
ower of His Word is not limited
by people; while all other religions are =
man-made, therefore they tend
to primarily stay within their own culture.=
 The same God who speaks to
all people through His creation of the heaven=
s and earth that draws
all people around the world likewise has sent His =
Word to the ends of
the earth so that we may come to personally know Him =
to be saved in
spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.
Jesus =
stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh
the scal=
es of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good
than bad in =
this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court of law? Bea=
ring the image of God, is this how we project this
image into reality?
=
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty
of=
 a crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but
rathe=
r by the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,
created in G=
od's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a
perfect, righteous=
, and Holy God?
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 comman=
dments given
to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may b=
e
justified, but rather that we may see the need for a savior. They are=

the mirror of God's character of what He has written in our hearts,
wi=
th our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is wrong to
steal, =
lie, dishonor our parents, murder, and so forth.
We can try and follow th=
e moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we
will never catch up to them t=
o be justified before a Holy God. That
same word of the law given to Mose=
s became flesh about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Jesus Christ. He came=
 to be our justification by
fulfilling the law, living a sinless perfect =
life that only God could
fulfill.
The gap between us and the law can ne=
ver be reconciled by our own
merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out=
 by the grace and mercy of
God. And if we are to grab on, through faith i=
n Him, He will pull us
up being the one to justify us. As in the court of=
 law, if someone
steps in and pays our fine, even though we are guilty, t=
he judge can
do what is legal and just and let us go free. That is what J=
esus did
almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction =
being
fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood with =
His
last word's on the cross crying out, "It is finished!" (John 19:30).=

For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23).
=
This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming
Messiah a=
nd His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it
pleased God to=
 crush His only begotten Son.
This is because the wrath that we deserve w=
as justified by being
poured out upon His Son. If that wrath was poured o=
ut on us, we would
all perish to hell forever. God created a way of escap=
e by pouring it
out on His Son whose soul could not be left in Hades but =
was raised
and seated at the right hand of God in power.
So now when we=
 put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God
no longer sees th=
e person who deserves His wrath, but rather the
glorious image of His per=
fect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if
we received the wrath we des=
erve, making a way of escape from the
curse of death; now being conformed=
 into the image of the heavenly man
walking in a new nature, and no longe=
r in the image of the fallen man
Adam.
Now what we must do is repent an=
d put our trust and faith in the
savior, confessing and forsaking our sin=
s, and to receive His Holy
Spirit that we may be born again (for Jesus sa=
ys we must be born again
to see and enter the Kingdom of God in John chap=
ter 3). This is not
just head knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather=
 receiving His
words, taking them to heart, so that we may truly be trans=
formed into
the image of God. Where we no longer live to practice sin, bu=
t rather
turn from our sins and practice righteousness through faith in H=
im in
obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.
Our works cannot save=
 us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we
earn our way into everlas=
ting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus
Christ:
Jesus says,
=
=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall e=
nter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heav=
en.
Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not pro=
phesied
in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders=
 in
Your name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never=
 knew you;
depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthe=
w 7:21-23)
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal sa=
lvation
to all who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)
"Now I saw a new heaven and=
 a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. A=
lso there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem=
, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her=
 husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the taber=
nacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be =
His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will =
wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor s=
orrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things hav=
e passed away.'
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all t=
hings new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faith=
ful.'
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the=

Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
lif=
e freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, a=
nd I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelievin=
g, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all=
 liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and brimst=
one, which is the second death.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8)

Throughout history, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to come =

<br />
In the book of Revelation 13:16-18, we read,<br />
<br />
"He (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles--Revelation 19:20)=
 causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receiv=

r of his name.<br />
<br />
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the b=
east, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666."<br />
<br />
Referring to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a cashless=
 society. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or sell unless =
we receive the mark of the beast. If physical money was still in use, we co=

tradict scripture that states we need the mark to buy or sell!<br />
<br />
These verses could not be referring to something purely spiritual as script=
ure references two physical locations (our right hand or forehead) stating =
the mark will be on one "OR" the other. If this mark was purely spiritual, =
it would indicate both places, not one OR the other.<br />
<br />
This is where it really starts to come together. It is shocking how accurat=
e the Bible is concerning the implantable RFID microchip. These are notes f=
rom a man named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help de=
velop this RFID chip<br />
<br />
"Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with heads-of-state=

<br />
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot about a =
person. God throughout history has given names to people that have a specif=
ic meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us tak=
e a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."=
<br />
<br />
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q" (baw-r=
awk)<br />
<br />
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying in his=
 heart:<br />
<br />
"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most Hig=
h."<br />
<br />
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times it me=
ntions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew word for the=
 heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116: "bamah"--Pronounced (=
bam-maw')<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U" or "O=
," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts together. So =
to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq) and a high place =
like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the letter "U" or "O" would=
 be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U" Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry simil=
ar to the style written in Isaiah, would translate literally to "Lightning =
from the heights." The word "Satan" in Hebrew is a direct translation, ther=
efore "Satan."<br />
<br />
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan fall li=
ke lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish Rabbi today=
 influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would say these words i=
n Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I saw Satan as Baraq O B=
am-Maw.<br />
<br />
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we were to=
 write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse) we would get=
 "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah bei=
ng the false god of Islam), we get "I am Satan". Coincidence? I don't think=
 so.<br />
<br />
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon in the=
 west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In Islam, they =
have their own messiah that they are waiting for called the 12th Imam, or t=
he Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one prophecy concerning this ma=
n's appearance is the sun rising in the west.<br />
<br />
"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlas=
ting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to every nati=
on, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God =
and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship H=
im who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.'" (Revelation 1=
4:6-7)<br />
<br />
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His death, bur=
ial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000 languages, and nothi=
ng comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)? Because the same Spirit of =
God (YHVH) who created all people likewise transcends all people; therefore=
 the power of His Word is not limited by people; while all other religions =
are man-made, therefore they tend to primarily stay within their own cultur=
e. The same God who speaks to all people through His creation of the heaven=
s and earth that draws all people around the world likewise has sent His Wo=
rd to the ends of the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to b=
e saved in spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh the =
scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good than bad i=
n this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a court of law? Bea=
ring the image of God, is this how we project this image into reality?<br /=
>
<br />
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty of a=
 crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but rather by=
 the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's i=
mage, pose this type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Ho=
ly God?<br />
<br />
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given to Mo=
ses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be justified, but rat=
her that we may see the need for a savior. They are the mirror of God's cha=
racter of what He has written in our hearts, with our conscious bearing wit=
ness that we know that it is wrong to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, mur=
der, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we will ne=
ver catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That same word of t=
he law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago in the body of Jes=
us Christ. He came to be our justification by fulfilling the law, living a =
sinless perfect life that only God could fulfill.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own merit, bu=
t the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. And if w=
e are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us up being the one to=
 justify us. As in the court of law, if someone steps in and pays our fine,=
 even though we are guilty, the judge can do what is legal and just and let=
 us go free. That is what Jesus did almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It=
 was a legal transaction being fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shed=
ding of His blood with His last word's on the cross crying out, "It is fini=
shed!" (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). This =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to crush Hi=
s only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would all perish to h=
ell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it out on His Son whose=
 soul could not be left in Hades but was raised and seated at the right han=
d of God in power.<br />
<br />
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God no lo=
nger sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image =
of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if we received the wrat=
h we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death; now being con=
formed into the image of the heavenly man walking in a new nature, and no l=
onger in the image of the fallen man Adam.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the savior, co=
nfessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy Spirit that we may=
 be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again to see and enter the K=
ingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not just head knowledge of believ=
ing in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart, so that=
 we may truly be transformed into the image of God. Where we no longer live=
 to practice sin, but rather turn from our sins and practice righteousness =
through faith in Him in obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.<br />
<br />
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we earn o=
ur way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus Christ:<br />
<br />
Jesus says,<br />
<br />
=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall e=
nter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven=
. Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophes=
ied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Yo=
ur name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew yo=
u; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)=
<br />
<br />
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to al=
l who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8)<grammarly-desktop-integration data-grammarl=
