It's time to say goodbye to plastic
Hey,

Let's talk about plastic.

There was a time when it made so much sense - it kept your food fresh, was easy to use and once you were done with it, you just threw it out.

Sounds great right?

Well, jump ahead a couple of decades and we've learned it's clogging our landfills, destroying our oceans and maybe most troubling of all - impacting our health.

“The nightmare scenario is that we one day find out that a lot more of our current disorders, including infertility and cancer, may be due to bisphenol A and only show up after cumulative exposure. But by then, we all have accumulated so much exposure that it's too late to reverse the effects,” (Harvard School of Public Health)

BPA (Bisphenol A) - the first chemical found in plastic to cause hormone disruption - isn't the only issue.

“Most plastic products, from sippy cups to food wraps, can release chemicals that act like the sex hormone estrogen, according to a study in Environmental Health Perspectives.” NPR

And even though these chemicals have been proven to seep into our food and bodies, our governments have been slow to protect us. Why? Many say Big Tobacco is to blame.

"Since the 1990s, a vast body of research has linked BPA and other chemicals found in plastics to serious health problems, ranging from cancer to infertility. But the industry—often using tactics pioneered by Big Tobacco as it sought to bury evidence about the health risks of smoking—has managed to shield these substances from federal regulation."​ (Mother Jones)

Which is why we're so excited about this truly game changing, natural and reusable foodwrap from etee (everything touches everything else). We love it because:

It reduces your exposure to plastic by using natural - organic - ingredients
It eliminates plastic waste and...
It keeps your food fresh.

It's made from organic Beeswax, coniferous tree resins, organic essential oils (jojoba, cinnamon and clove) and a touch of non gmo soy wax infused in a hemp and organic cotton cloth.

rbeer had been asked by Louis Véron, the director of the Opéra, for a new work. At first he attempted to persuade Véron to accept the opéra-comique Le portefaix to a libretto by Scribe,[n 3] which he had been contracted to compose in early 1831; but Véron insisted on a full five-act piece. Together with Scribe, Meyerbeer reviewed many subjects before deciding, in 1832, on Les Huguenots. The contract which Meyerbeer signed with Véron contained a penalty clause if the work was not delivered by the end of 1833. When the time came and the opera was not ready, Véron claimed his 30,000 francs under this clause; Meyerbeer was perhaps unique amongst composers in being able to pay this. In fact Véron refunded the money under a further agreement, when the opera was delivered in late 1834; but Veron himself was replaced as director of the Opera by Henri Duponchel before Les Huguenots was premiered on 29 February 1836.[41] It was an immediate and immense success, its splendid staging and effects exceeding even those of Fromental Halévy's La Juive, which had premiered the previous year.[42] Berlioz called the score "a musical encyclopaedia", and the singing, especially of Nourrit and Falcon, was universally praised.[43] Les Huguenots was the first opera to be performed at the Opéra more than 1,000 times (the 1,000th performance being on 16 May 1906)[44] and continued to be produced up to 1936, more than a century after its premiere.[45] Its many performances in all other of the world's major opera houses give it a claim to being the most successful opera of the 19th century. However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, including the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister and director of the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab.[46] There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin (and indeed in many other cities of Germany).[47] Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumst
