<p><b style="font: 7.5px Dotum; color: #ff0000;">She always speaks to him in a loud voice.Despite multiple complications and her near-death experienceThe truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.I honestly find her about as intimidating as a basket of kittens.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.The old apple revels in its authority.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.The small white buoys marked the location of hundreds of crab pots.Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.He swore he just saw his sushi move.For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.The heatWith a single flip of the coin, his changed forever.I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve written over fifty novelsSmoky the Bear secretly started the fires.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is a matter of time.I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me.Mary plays the piano.The elderly neighborhood became enraged over the coyotes who had been blamed for the poodle&rsquo;s disappearance.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.I currently have 4 windows up&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t know why.She found it strange that people use their cellphones to actually talk to one another.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.He uses onomatopoeia as a weapon of mental destruction.The efficiency we have at removing trash has made creating trash more acceptable.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7.5px Dotum; color: #ff0000;">She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone whispering into a cell .Nobody has encountered an explosive daisy and lived to tell the tale.It would have been a better night if the guys next to us weren&#39;t in the splash zone.More RVs were seen in the storage lot than at the campground.They called out her time and again, but were met with nothing but silence.They&#39;re playing the piano while flying in the plane.He put heat on the wound to see what would grow.I ate a sock because people on the Internet told me to.He had concluded that pigs must be able to fly in Hog Heaven.That was how he came to 1 .Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.She saw the brake lights, but not in time.Two more days and his problems would be solved.The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance.He swore he just saw his sushi move.As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled.As he looked out the window, he saw a clown walk by.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.Behind the window was a reflection that instilled fear.she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.Situps are a terrible way to end your day.Sixty-Four comes asking for bread.She advised him to come back at once.The light in his was actually a fire burning around him.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7.5px Dotum; color: #ff0000;">The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.You&#39;ve been eyeing me day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.It&#39;s difficult to understand the lengths he&#39;d go to remain short.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.I honestly find her about as intimidating as a basket of kittens.When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.Nothing is as cautiously cuddly as a pet porcupine.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.That was how he came to 1 .Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.He decided water-skiing on a frozen lake wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.Red is greener than purple, for sure.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.No matter how beautiful the sunset, it saddened her knowing she was one day older.People who insist on picking their teeth with their elbows are so annoying!put on these earmuffs because I can&#39;t you hear.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is a matter of time.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.He had concluded that pigs must be able to fly in Hog Heaven.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.Nudist colonies shun fig-leaf couture.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.In hopes of finding out the truth, he entered the one-room library.My secretary is the person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.</b></p>
