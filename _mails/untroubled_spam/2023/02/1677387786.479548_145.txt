Vedel, Berezovsky and Bortniansky are recognised by modern scholars as the "Golden Three" composers of Ukrainian classical music during the end of the 18th century,[36] and the outstanding composers at a time when church music was reaching its peak in eastern Europe.[5] They composed some of the greatest choral music to emerge from the Russian Empire.[18] Vedel made an important contribution in the music history of Ukraine,[37][38] and musicologists consider him to the archetypal composer of the baroque style in Ukrainian music.[8] Koshetz stated that Vedel should be seen as "the first and greatest spokesperson of the national substance in Ukrainian church music".[29] The musical culture that developed in Ukraine during the 19th century were founded in part on Vedel's choral compositions. According to the ethnomusicologist Taras Filenko, "His free command of contemporary techniques of choral writing, combined with innovations in adapting the particularities of Ukrainian melody, make Artem Vedel's works a unique phenomenon in the context of world musical culture."[39] According to Chekan, Vedel's texture is "at times monumental and at others subtly contrasted, strikingly showing the possibilities of the a cappella sound".[1] A memorial plaque to Vedel was made by the sculptor Igor Grechanyk [uk] in 2008. The plaque is located on the wall of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.[40] The Vedel School in Lviv, a school of contemporary music founded in 2017 by the musician Mikhail Balog, was named in honour of the composer.[41] There are streets named after the composer in Kyiv and Kharkiv
