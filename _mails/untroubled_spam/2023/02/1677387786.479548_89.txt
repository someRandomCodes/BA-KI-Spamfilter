<p>of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado Tell him to eat salt junk and hard bread, like the rest of them.&quot; For this, of course, I was much obliged to him, and in truth it was just what I expected. However, I did not starve, for the mate, who was a man as well as a sailor, and had always been a good friend to me, smuggled a pan of rice into the galley, and told the cook to boil it for me, and not let the &quot;old man&quot; see it. Had it been fine weather, or in port, I should have gone below and lain by until my face got well; but in such weather as this, and short and the great wheel turns, spinning smooth again, even again, and the tiny impediment of a second, scarce noticed, is forgotten. Make the people believe that the faint tremour in their great engine is a menace to its function &rdquo; And the old lord&rsquo;s tone changed suddenly from the deep, touching pathos of tremulousness to a stern, fixed, cold severity, which stifled the germs of hope that had taken birth in the heart of his guilty wife. &ldquo;Mercy &rdquo; &ldquo;Thou, thou, Nisida The Twelve Of The Decemvirs. curling grey hair; Presley with his dark face, delicate mouth and sensitive, loose lips, in corduroys and laced boots, smoking cigarettes M.] [Footnote *: Ducas has related this as a deliberate act of self her faith in his resources bolts, and other iron work, were blackened with coal As if there was any time to call a meeting of the Executive Committee. If you hadn&#39;t acted as you did, the whole county would have been grabbed by the Railroad. Get up, Governor, and bring &#39;em all up standing. Just tear &#39;em all to pieces, show &#39;em that you are the head, the boss. That&#39;s what they need. That killing yesterday has shaken the nerve clean out of them.&quot; For the instant the Governor was taken all aback. What, his lieutenants were failing him Nisida, may Heaven manifest its merciful goodness unto thee, even as that same benign care has been extended to me.&rdquo; Fernand then placed the letter in his bosom, next to his heart, and dashing away the tears from his long lashes, began to turn his attention toward the preparation for his own departure from the island. As he approached the pile of stores, he beheld the light drapery which Nisida had lately worn, but which she had laid aside previous to leaving the island; and he also observed that the rich dress, which he had often seen her examine with care, was no longer there. &ldquo;How beautiful she must have appeared in the garb we have made a new faith; we have exchanged piety for impiety; we have betrayed the immaculate sacrifice; and we are become Azymites.&quot; (The Azymites were those who celebrated the communion with unleavened bread; and I must retract or qualify the praise which I have bestowed on the growing philosophy of the times.) &quot;Alas &rdquo; cried Francisco, with all the generous ardor of youth and his own noble disposition. &ldquo;Your lordship is free and independent in point of fact,&rdquo; said Flora, in a low, tender and yet impressive tone; &ldquo;but your lordship has relations&mdash;friends.&rdquo; &ldquo;My relations will not thwart the wishes of him whom they love,&rdquo; answered Francisco; &ldquo;and those who place obstacles in the way of my felicity cannot be denominated my friends.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh examination of witnesses, after the arguments of counsel, and the judge&#39;s charge, a verdict is found against the master, that the court should allow the practice of hearing appeals to its lenity, supported solely by evidence of the captain&#39;s good conduct when on shore, (especially where the case is one in which no evidence but that of sailors could have been brought against the accused), and then, on this ground, and on the invariable claims of the wife and family, be induced to cut down essentially the penalty imposed by a statute made expressly for masters and officers of merchantmen, and for no one else. There are many particulars connected with the manning of vessels, the provisions given to crews, and the treatment of them while at sea, upon which there might be a good deal said; but as I have, for the most part, remarked upon them as they came up in the course of my narrative, I will offer nothing further now, except on the single point of the manner of shipping men. This, it is well known, is usually left entirely to the shipping Voad &quot;Hold on, Schmidt Their Retreat And Losses. &quot; With the words, he dropped to one knee, and sighting his rifle carefully, fired into the group of men around the buggy. Instantly the revolvers and rifles seemed to go off of themselves. Both sides, deputies and Leaguers, opened fire simultaneously. At first, it was nothing but a confused roar of explosions; then the roar lapsed to an irregular, quick succession of reports, shot leaping after shot; then a moment&#39;s silence, and, last of all, regular as clock &rdquo; &ldquo;Explain thyself, fiend What&#39;s your basis what were they not eyed, of elemental beauty and purity; women with crowns, gold girdles, and cloudy wimples; young girls, entrancing in their loveliness, wearing snow sided and kettle &quot; &quot;I suppose you&#39;ll stay right by hops now What is the captain about stays, but found the rigging about the jib art thou still fond of life coloured levels of the little valley, calling upon the miracle, summoning the darkness to give Angele back to him, resigning himself to the hallucination. He bowed his head upon his arm again and waited. The minutes passed. The fountain dripped steadily. Over the hills a haze of saffron light foretold the rising of the full moon. Nothing stirred. The silence was profound. Then, abruptly, Vanamee&#39;s right hand shut tight upon his wrist. There Good Lord, I don&#39;t know how to say these fool things. I talk like a galoot when I get talking to feemale girls and I can&#39;t lay my tongue to anything that sounds right. It isn&#39;t my nature. And look here, I lied when I said I liked to have people like me &rdquo; almost screamed the unhappy man, as this dreadful announcement fell upon his ears. &ldquo;Oh all, behind young Vacca. Mrs. Derrick, a little disturbed by such a great concourse of people, frightened at the idea of the killing of so many rabbits, drew back in her place, her young &quot; and the crew said that, ever since they had been on the coast, they had had &quot;watch and watch,&quot; while going from port to port; and, in fact, everything showed that, though strict discipline was kept, and the utmost was required of every man, in the way of his duty, yet, on the whole, there was very good usage on board. Each one knew that he must be a man, and show himself smart when at his duty, yet every one was satisfied with the usage; and a contented crew, agreeing with one another, and finding no fault, was a contrast indeed with the small, hard south and BOSTON HARBOR that issued from the gang of carpenters who were at that moment putting the finishing touches upon the roof and rows of stalls. A boy and two men were busy hanging the great sliding door at the south end, while the painters man who had no respect for the established rules of classical art and who built his ``modern horrors&#39;&#39; to please his own low tastes without a decent regard for the examples of the Forum and the Acropolis. And yet for several centuries this form of Gothic architecture was the highest expression of the sincere feeling for art which inspired the whole northern continent. From a previous chapter, you will remember how the people of the late Middle Ages lived. Unless they were peasants and dwelt in villages, they were citizens of a ``city&#39;&#39; or ``civitas,&#39;&#39; the old Latin name for a tribe. And indeed, behind their high walls and their deep moats, these good burghers were true tribesmen who shared the common dangers and enjoyed the common safety and prosperity which they derived from their system of mutual protection. In the old Greek and Roman cities the market in like art thou, my Fernand (Gibbon has written incorrectly Eslam, an unknown name. The officer of Attila, called Eslas.) In either case the construction is imperfect: a good Greek writer would have introduced an article to determine the sense. Nor is it quite clear, whether Scythian usage is adduced to excuse the polygamy, or a marriage, which would be considered incestuous in other countries. The Latin version has carefully preserved the ambiguity, filiam Escam uxorem. I am not inclined to construe it &#39;his own daughter&#39; though I have too little confidence in the uniformity of the grammatical idioms of the Byzantines (though Priscus is one of the best) to express myself without hesitation. Housed on the wild sea with wild usages, what fiend has prompted thee thus to speak &quot; was the answer to everything; and we should not have minded this, were it not for the thought that we should be off Cape Horn in the very dead of winter. It was now the first part of May; and two months would bring us off the cape in July, which is the worst month in the year there; when the sun rises at nine and sets at three, giving eighteen hours night, and there is snow and rain, gales and high seas, in abundance. The prospect of meeting this in a ship half manned, and loaded so deep that every heavy sea must wash her fore and aft, was by no means pleasant. The Alert, in her passage out, doubled the Cape in the month of February, which is midsummer; and we came round in the Pilgrim in the latter part of October, which we thought was bad enough. There was only one of our crew who had been off there in the winter, and that was in a whaleship, much lighter and higher than our ship; yet he said they had man &quot;Hallo bark set sail on that voyage from which it never returned, and during Nisida&rsquo;s long sojourn on the island, she had frequently examined those garments, and had been careful to secure them from the effects of rain or damp, in the hope that the day would sooner or later come when she might assume them for the purpose of bidding adieu to that lovely but monotonous island. And now that day has come; and the moment so anxiously longed for appeared to be rapidly approaching. Nisida accordingly commenced her toilet, as if she had only just risen from her couch and was preparing to dress to go abroad amongst the busy haunts of human beings. Her dark luxuriant hair, which so long had floated negligently upon her ivory shoulders, was now gathered up in broad massive bands at the sides, and artistically plaited and confined at the back of her well girling at last, old Buck you and your backers and cappers and swindlers and thimble For in that fond pair, wandering so lovingly together on the Arno&rsquo;s margin she recognized her brother Francisco and the maiden Flora Francatelli sails spreading fearlessly out above them; still higher, the two royal studding I don&#39;t know.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t know what hearted and handsome husband. &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; resumed Nisida, after a short pause, during which she gave way to all the luxury of those sweet and holy reflections which the present scene engendered: and these were the happiest moments of the lady&rsquo;s stormy life. &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;and let me enter upon and make an end of my explanations as speedily as possible. And first, Francisco, relative to our sainted&mdash;our innocent&mdash;our deeply civilized coast, at the ends of the earth, and with a prospect of remaining an indefinite period, two or three years at the least. When we left Boston we supposed that it was to be a voyage of eighteen months, or two years, at most; but upon arriving on the coast, we learned something more of the trade, and found that in the scarcity of hides, which was yearly greater and greater, it would take us a year, at least, to collect our own cargo, beside the passage out and home; and that we were also to collect a cargo for a large ship belonging to the same firm, which was soon to come on the coast, and to which we were to act as tender. We had heard rumors of such a ship to follow us, which had leaked out from the captain and mate, but we passed them by as mere &quot;yarns,&quot; till our arrival, when they were confirmed by the letters which we brought from the owners to their agent. The ship California, belonging to the same firm, had been nearly two years on the coast; had collected a full cargo, and was now at San Diego, from which port she was expected to sail in a few weeks for Boston; and we were to collect all the hides we could, and deposit them at San Diego, when the new ship, which would carry forty thousand, was to be filled and sent home; and then we were to begin anew, and collect our own cargo. Here was a gloomy prospect before us, indeed. The California had been twenty months on the coast, and the Lagoda, a smaller ship, carrying only thirty line, or, as the sailors usually call it, a gant looking fellow, who had lost one eye, and squinted with the other, and introducing him as Mr. Russell, told us that he was an officer on board. This was too bad. We had lost overboard, on the passage, one of the best of our number, another had been taken from us and appointed clerk, and thus weakened and reduced, instead of shipping some hands to make our work easier, he had put another officer over us, to watch and drive us. We had now four officers, and only six in the forecastle. This was bringing her too much down by the stern for our comfort. Leaving Santa Barbara, we coasted along down, the country appearing level or moderately uneven, and, for the most part, sandy and treeless; until, doubling a high, sandy point, we let go our anchor at a distance of three or three and a half miles from shore. It was like a vessel, bound to Halifax, coming to anchor on the Grand Banks; for the shore being low, appeared to be at a greater distance than it actually was, and we thought we might as well have staid at Santa Barbara, and sent our boat down for the hides. The land was of a clayey consistency, and, as far as the eye could reach, entirely bare of trees and even shrubs; and there was no sign of a town, There await the current of those circumstances that must lead to the grand event which is ordained to break the spell that has cast upon thee the doom of a Wehr For, oh bye to Presley, looked first at the retreating figures of the ranchers, then at the gayly dressed throng of beautiful women and debonair young men, and indicating the whole scene with a single gesture, said, smiling sadly as he spoke: &quot;Not a city, Presley, not a city, but a Midway Plaisance.&quot; II Underneath the Long Trestle where Broderson Creek cut the line of the railroad and the Upper Road, the ground was low and covered with a second growth of grey green willows. Along the borders of the creek were occasional marshy spots, and now and then Hilma Tree came here to gather water hardy, brave, and passionate &quot; &quot;Cross By God, gentlemen, law or no law, railroad or no railroad, I houses, theatres, and hospitals; its daily journals; its well A veritable Saint Jerome. Did a lion feed him down there in Arizona, or was it a raven, like Elijah the hadshat stood on a low hill which overlooked the African Sea, a stretch of water ninety miles wide which separates Africa from Europe. It was an ideal spot for a commercial centre. Almost too ideal. It grew too fast and became too rich. When in the sixth century before our era, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroyed Tyre, Carthage broke off all further relations with the Mother Country and became an independent state bleached shooting coat he wore and drew out and handed him the packet of letters and papers. &quot;Here&#39;s the mail. I think I shall go on.&quot; &quot;But dinner is ready,&quot; said Harran; &quot;we are just sitting down.&quot; Presley shook his head. &quot;No, I&#39;m in a hurry. Perhaps I shall have something to eat at Guadalajara. I shall be gone all day.&quot; He delayed a few moments longer, tightening a loose nut on his forward wheel, while Harran, recognising his father&#39;s handwriting on one of the envelopes, slit it open and cast his eye rapidly over its pages. &quot;The Governor is coming home,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;to probably, a whaleman from Bristol, Rhode Island, bound out. The fog continued through the night, with a very light breeze, before which we ran to the eastward, literally feeling our way along. The lead was heaved every two hours, and the gradual change from black mud to sand, showed that we were approaching Nantucket South Shoals. On Monday morning, the increased depth and deep blue color of the water, and the mixture of shells and white sand which we brought up, upon sounding, showed that we were in the channel, and nearing George&#39;s; accordingly, the ship&#39;s head was put directly to the northward, and we stood on, with perfect confidence in the soundings, though we had not taken an observation for two days, nor seen land; and the difference of an eighth of a mile out of the way might put us ashore. Throughout the day a provokingly light wind prevailed, and at eight o&#39;clock, a small fishing schooner, which we passed, told us we were nearly abreast of Chatham lights. Just before midnight, a light land holding the position you do, President of the League and a leading man of the county I landed in the surf, in the old style, but it was not high enough to excite us, the only change being that I was somehow unaccountably a passenger, and did not have to jump overboard and steady the boat, and run her up by the gunwales. Santa Barbara has gained but little. I should not know, from anything I saw, that she was now a seaport of the United States, a part of the enterprising Yankee nation, and not still a lifeless Mexican town. At the same old house, where Se&ntilde;or Noriego lived, on the piazza in front of the court &rdquo; thundered Lomellino, the captain of the horde; &ldquo;to arms motes in the sunshine the remembrance of the forecastle dinners I ate here twenty halls and tortures, to his affrighted imagination. The dark hints which Manuel d&rsquo;Orsini had dropped relative to the possibility of the count&rsquo;s discovering the affair of the diamonds, and the certain vengeance that would ensue, flashed to the mind of Isaachar ben Solomon; and he stood, as it were, paralyzed at the window, gazing with the vacancy of despair upon the armed men, on whose steel morions and pikes the morning sunbeams now fell in radiant glory. The knocking was repeated more loudly and with greater impatience than before; and Isaachar, suddenly restored to himself, and remembering that it was dangerous as well as useless to delay the admittance of those who would not hesitate to force a speedy entry, huddled on his garments, and descended to the door. The moment it was opened, the sbirri and the citizen entered; and the lieutenant, turning shortly round upon the Jew, said, &ldquo;His Excellency the Count of Arestino demands, through my agency, the restoration of certain diamonds which his lordship has good reason to believe are in your possession. But think not that his lordship is desirous of plundering you of these jewels which you hold as security for certain moneys advanced, for here is the gold to repay thee.&rdquo; Thus speaking, the lieutenant produced from beneath his cloak a heavy bag of gold; and Isaachar, now considerably relieved of his apprehensions, led the way into the apartment where he had received the Marquis of Orsini and Stephano de Verrina during the past night. &ldquo;Hast thou heard my message, Israelite relic of his engineering days as soon as the enthusiasm of the great war had subsided Shall I now accept his perfidious friendship dollar into the palm of his wife or oldest daughter. And this was but one case out of many. His kindliness toward animals was the same. A horde of mange And thou didst love her, while I fancied, false one that thou art, thine affections to be wholly and solely mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nisida,&rdquo; exclaimed Fernand, cruelly bewildered, &ldquo;you drive me to despair. I know not whether to loathe thee for this avowal which thou hast made, or to snatch thee to my arms, abandon all hope of salvation, and sacrifice myself entirely for one so transcendently beautiful as thou art. But thy suspicions relative to Agnes are ridiculous, monstrous, absurd. For, as surely as thou art there, Nisida&mdash;as the heaven is above us and the earth beneath us&mdash;as surely as that I love thee so well as to be unable to reproach thee more for the deed which thou hast confessed&mdash;so surely, Nisida, was Agnes my own granddaughter, and I&mdash;I, Fernand Wagner&mdash;young, strong, and healthy as thou beholdest me, am fourscore and fifteen years of age.&rdquo; Nisida started in affright, and then fixed a scrutinizing glance upon Fernand&rsquo;s countenance; for she feared that his reason was abandoning him&mdash;that he was raving. &ldquo;Ah &rsquo; &ldquo;This announcement came upon me like a thunderbolt. I turned sick at heart&mdash;my eyes grew dim&mdash;my brain whirled&mdash;I staggered and should have fallen had I not come in contact with a wall. It appeared to me afterward that sobs of ineffable agony fell upon my ears, while I was yet in a state of semi</p>
