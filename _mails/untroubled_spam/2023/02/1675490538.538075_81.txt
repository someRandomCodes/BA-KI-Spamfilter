<p><b style="font: 7px Coronetscript; color: #5C5858;">It was difficult for Mary to admit that most of her workout consisted of exercising poor judgment.Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can&#39;t read.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.The Japanese yen for commerce is still well-known.The secret ingredient to his was crime.I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.There&#39;s a reason that roses have thorns.She was the type of girl who wanted to live in a pink house.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.She found his complete dullness interesting.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.It&#39;s much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.Courage and stupidity were ll he had.You&#39;re unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.He found his art progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.Fluffy pink unicorns are a popular status symbol among macho men.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.He wore the surgical mask in public not to keep from catching a virus, but to keep people away from him.The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance.Tody arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.It&#39;s not possible to convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising it infinite bananas when they die.wait outside of the house.The shooter says goodbye to his love.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.Thigh-high in the water, the fisherman&rsquo;s hope for dinner turned to despair.</b></p>
