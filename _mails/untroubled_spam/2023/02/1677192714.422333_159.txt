<div id="output">Have they left for good Haven&#39;t I enough on my hands without you &rdquo; said Wagner, who had returned to her unperceived, and unheard&mdash;for his feet passed noiselessly over the sand; &ldquo;wherefore those passionate exclamations Fool that I was to delay my triumph hitherto Did you give me the right schedule Steep oneself in the heat of the desert, the glory of the sunset, the blue haze of the mesa and the canyon.&quot; &quot;As you have done, for instance &quot; he demanded. &quot;Do you want me to lock you up &quot; &quot;Oh he drew not his scimiter to defend her&mdash;he no longer remembered all the tender love she bore him&mdash;but, appalled by the menace of the bowstring, backed by the warrant of the sultan&rsquo;s signet ring, he lay groveling on the rich Persian carpet, giving vent to his alarms by low and piteous groans. Then he heard the door once more close as softly as possible: he looked up&mdash;glared with wild anxiety around&mdash;and breathed more freely on finding himself alone or of his great liberality through all Ionia I&#39;ll show you young fellows. I&#39;m a regular old ROOSTER when I get started.&quot; He marched out into the barn, the others following, holding their sides. He found an aged Mexican woman by the door and hustled her, all confused and giggling, into the Virginia reel, then at its height. Every one crowded around to see. Old Broderson stepped off with the alacrity of a colt, snapping his fingers, slapping his thigh, his mouth widening in an excited grin. The entire company of the guests shouted. The City Band redoubled their efforts; and the old man, losing his head, breathless, gasping, dislocated his stiff joints in his efforts. He became possessed, bowing, scraping, advancing, retreating, wagging his beard, cutting pigeons&#39; wings, distraught with the music, the clamour, the applause, the effects of the fertiliser. Annixter shouted: &quot;Nice eye, Santa Claus.&quot; But Annixter&#39;s attention wandered. He searched for Hilma Tree, having still in mind the look in her eyes at that swift moment of danger. He had not seen her since then. At last he caught sight of her. She was not dancing, but, instead, was sitting with her &quot;partner&quot; at the end of the barn near her father and mother, her eyes wide, a serious expression on her face, her thoughts, no doubt, elsewhere. Annixter was about to go to her when he was interrupted by a cry. Old Broderson, in the midst of a double shuffle, had clapped his hand to his side with a gasp, which he followed by a whoop of anguish. He had got a stitch or had started a twinge somewhere. With a gesture of resignation, he drew himself laboriously out of the dance, limping abominably, one leg dragging. He was heard asking for his wife. Old Mrs. Broderson took him in charge. She jawed him for making an exhibition of himself, scolding as though he were a ten- year-old. &quot;Well, I want to know &rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she responded, without daring to raise her eyes to meet mine. I knew that she lied, most foully lied: her confusion, her whole manner betrayed her. But I exercised a powerful mastery over my mind; the suspicion which I had all along entertained was strengthened greatly, but not altogether confirmed; and I resolved to wait for confirmation ere I allowed my vengeance to burst forth. Moreover, it was necessary to discover who the gallant might be&mdash;the favored one who had superseded me in the affections of Vitangela I&#39;m a wild-eyed striker, ain&#39;t I &rsquo; she absolutely shrieked forth. Then perceiving that I was perfectly amazed and horrified by the wild vehemence of her ejaculations, she said in a subdued, melancholy tone, &lsquo;I adjure you to think of me no more.&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Listen, beauteous stranger,&rsquo; I exclaimed; &lsquo;I love and adore you. My happiness is at stake. Repeat that cruel adjuration, and you inflict a death-blow. If I be loathsome to your sight, tell me so; but leave me not a prey to the most horrible suspense. If you have a father, I will accompany you to him and make honorable proposals.&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;My father &rdquo; Then she hastily secured the ducal missive in an iron box where she was in the habit of keeping her own private papers, and which opened with a secret spring. But did she, then, mean to renounce her love for Wagner &quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he answered. &quot;Only the emergency brakes. Just a cow on the track, I guess. Don&#39;t get scared. It isn&#39;t anything.&quot; But with a final shriek of the Westinghouse appliance, the train came to a definite halt. At once the silence was absolute. The ears, still numb with the long-continued roar of wheels and clashing iron, at first refused to register correctly the smaller noises of the surroundings. Voices came from the other end of the car, strange and unfamiliar, as though heard at a great distance across the water. The stillness of the night outside was so profound that the rain, dripping from the car roof upon the road-bed underneath, was as distinct as the ticking of a clock. &quot;Well, we&#39;ve sure stopped,&quot; observed one of the drummers. &quot;What is it I know I&#39;ve got enemies; piles of them. I could name you half a dozen men right now that are naturally itching to take a shot at me. How about this ranch &quot; &quot;Water,&quot; returned Dyke. &quot;They&#39;ve watched every spring. I&#39;m killed with thirst.&quot; &quot;There&#39;s the hydrant. Quick now.&quot; &quot;I got as far as the Kern River, but they turned me back,&quot; he said between breaths as he drank. &quot;Don&#39;t stop to talk.&quot; &quot;My mother, and the little tad----&quot; &quot;I&#39;m taking care of them. They&#39;re stopping with me.&quot; Here better to have endured all this, than to have taken on myself a new tenure of that existence which is so marked with misery and woe spare me, dear lady&mdash;have mercy upon me&mdash;have mercy upon me no &quot;--&quot;Ice on the lee bow Moreover, do the Arabians and Syrians now first of all begin to govern themselves as they please, and to indulge their appetites in a foreign war, and then, out of their barbarity in murdering men, and out of their hatred to the Jews, get it ascribed to the Romans Do you know that I see now that I made the mistake of my life there, that time, under the Long Trestle &rdquo; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;vengeance shalt thou have, comrade,&rdquo; returned the deep, sonorous voice of Stephano. But scarcely were those words uttered, when the loud clanging of the bell struck up; and the abbess exclaimed joyfully, &ldquo;We are saved &rdquo; And Wagner proceeded to delineate, in minute terms, the portraiture of the mysterious lady who had inspired Agnes on three occasions with so much terror, and whom Agnes herself had depicted in such glowing language. &ldquo;Signor &rdquo; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I remember&mdash;but my brain is confused &quot; And that was all; but to Annixter it was a revelation. Never more alive to his surroundings, never more observant, he suddenly understood. For the briefest lapse of time he and Hilma looked deep into each other&#39;s eyes, and from that moment on, Annixter knew that Hilma cared. The whole matter was brief as the snapping of a finger. Two words and a glance and all was done. But as though nothing had occurred, Annixter pushed Hilma from him, repeating harshly: &quot;Get back, I tell you. Don&#39;t you see he&#39;s got a gun &quot; &quot;I&#39;m going away, sir.&quot; The Governor did not answer. Staring at the ledge of the desk, he seemed lost in thought. There was a long silence. Then, at length, Presley said: &quot;How are you getting on, Governor I doand know,&quot; returned the other, insistently. &quot;Dat&#39;s my home yonder. Dat&#39;s my Vaterland. Alle von we Shairmens yoost like dot. Shairmany, dot&#39;s hell oaf some fine plaice, sure. Budt der Vaterland iss vhair der home und der wife und kinder iss. Eh Only way to manage a big ranch these days. But the day of the big ranch is over. As the land appreciates in value, the temptation to sell off small holdings will be too strong. And then the small holding can be cultivated to better advantage. I shall have an editorial on that some day.&quot; &quot;The cost of maintaining a number of small holdings,&quot; said Magnus, indifferently, &quot;is, of course, greater than if they were all under one management.&quot; &quot;That may be, that may be,&quot; rejoined the other. There was a long pause. Genslinger leaned back in his chair and rubbed a knee. Magnus, standing erect in front of the safe, waited for him to speak. &quot;This is an unfortunate business, Governor,&quot; began the editor, &quot;this misunderstanding between the ranchers and the Railroad. I wish it could be adjusted. HERE are two industries that MUST be in harmony with one another, or we all go to pot.&quot; &quot;I should prefer not to be interviewed on the subject, Mr. Genslinger,&quot; said Magnus. &quot;Oh, no, oh, no. Lord love you, Governor, I don&#39;t want to interview you. We all know how you stand.&quot; Again there was a long silence. Magnus wondered what this little man, usually so garrulous, could want of him. At length, Genslinger began again. He did not look at Magnus, except at long intervals. &quot;About the present Railroad Commission,&quot; he remarked. &quot;That was an interesting campaign you conducted in Sacramento and San Francisco.&quot; Magnus held his peace, his hands shut tight. Did Genslinger know of Lyman&#39;s disgrace The scrupulous Amurath is no more; his throne is occupied by a young conqueror, whom no laws can bind, and no obstacles can resist: and if you escape from his hands, give praise to the divine clemency, which yet delays the chastisement of your sins. Why do ye seek to affright us by vain and indirect menaces &rdquo; He covered his face with his hands and wept bitterly. The lieutenant made a sign to his follower, who instantly quitted the room. &ldquo;There must be some mistake in this, signor,&rdquo; said the old porter, approaching the lieutenant and speaking in a voice tremulous with emotion. &ldquo;The master whom I serve, and whom you accuse, is incapable of the deed imputed to him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes. God knows how truly you speak</div>
