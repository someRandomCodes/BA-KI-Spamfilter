In December 1796, on the orders of Tsar Paul I, the Kharkiv Governorate was abolished, and was replaced by the newly created Sloboda Ukrainian Governorate.[22] Levanidov was dismissed on 9 January 1797,[23] when his corps was disbanded by Paul I, and he left Kharkiv. Paul I decreed that all regimental chapels were to be abolished, which caused Vedel to resign from the army in October 1797. He worked as a musician for the governor of the new province, Aleksey Teplov [ru]. Teplov, who as a young man had received an excellent musical education, treated Vedel as well as he could.[9] The tsar's decrees caused the cultural and artistic life of Kharkiv to decline. The city's theatre was closed, and its choirs and orchestras were dissolved. Performances of Vedel's works in churches were banned,[9] as the tsar had prohibited singing in churches of any form of music except during the Divine Liturgy.[24] The loss of Levanidov's support caused Vedel to become deeply depressed.[24] Despite the support he received from Teplov, Vedel decided to leave Kharkiv. He distributed his belongings (including all his manuscripts),[14] and the end of the summer of 1798 he returned to live at his parents' house in Kyiv. There he wrote two choral concertos, "God, the law-breaker of the rebellion against me" (11 November 1798) and "To the Lord we always mourn". The concertos were performed in the Epiphany Cathedral [uk] and St Sophia Cathedral in the city
