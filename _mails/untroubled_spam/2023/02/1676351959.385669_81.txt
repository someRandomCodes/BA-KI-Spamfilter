<p><b style="font: 4px Palatino; color: #0C090A;">It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.Nudist colonies shun fig-leaf couture.Having no hair made him look even hairier.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.After coating myself in vegetable oil I found my sucess rte skyrocketed.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this about?The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.Pink horses galloped across the sea.The balloons floated away along with my hopes and dreams.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.I cheated while playing the darts tournament by using a longbow.It turns out you don&#39;t need that stuff you insisted you did.There&#39;s a message for if you look up.He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the class.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.The tree fell unexpectedly short.The gloves protect my feet from excess work.The body piercing didn&#39;t go exactly as he expected.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.Mary plays the piano.Two more days and his problems would be solved.The virus had powers none of us knew existed.is the day I&#39;ll finally know what brick tastes like.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.The door slammed on the watermelon.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.</b></p>
