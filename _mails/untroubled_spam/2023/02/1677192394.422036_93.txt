<div id="output">jib that chap Presley, for instance three grain drills, each with its eight hoes, went clamouring past, like an advance of military, seeding the ten thousand acres of the great ranch; fecundating the living soil; implanting deep in the dark womb of the Earth the germ of life, the sustenance of a whole world, the food of an entire People. When the drills had passed, Annixter turned and rode back to the Lower Road, over the land now thick with seed. He did not wonder that the seeding on Los Muertos seemed to be hastily conducted. Magnus and Harran Derrick had not yet been able to make up the time lost at the beginning of the season, when they had waited so long for the ploughs to arrive. They had been behindhand all the time. On Annixter&#39;s ranch, the land had not only been harrowed, as well as seeded, but in some cases, cross one who is always trying to get clear of work, and is out of the way, or hanging back, when duty is to be done. &quot;Marine&quot; is the term applied more particularly to a man who is ignorant and clumsy about seaman&#39;s work ropes for more than half an hour, carrying out, hooking and unhooking the tackles, several times buried in the seas, until the mate ordered us in, from fear of our being washed off. The anchors were then to be taken up on the rail, which kept all hands on the forecastle for an hour, though every now and then the seas broke over it, washing the rigging off to leeward, filling the lee scuppers breast high, and washing chock aft to the taffrail. Having got everything secure again, we were promising ourselves some breakfast, for it was now nearly nine o&#39;clock in the forenoon, when the main topsail showed evident signs of giving way. Some sail must be kept on the ship, and the captain ordered the fore and main spencer gaffs to be lowered down, and the two spencers (which were storm sails, bran new, small, and made of the strongest canvas) to be got up and bent; leaving the main topsail to blow away, with a blessing on it, if it would only last until we could set the spencers. These we bent on very carefully, with strong robands and seizings, and making tackles fast to the clews, bowsed them down to the water of course + with guns what a tragedy CHAPTER XIII. NISIDA&rsquo;S EMOTIONS&mdash;THE DISGUISE&mdash;THE PLOT. We must now return to Nisida, whom we left gazing from the window of the Riverola mansion, at the moment when Wagner rushed away from the vicinity of his lady five cubits; for it being built over against a higher part of the hill with steps, it was no further to be entirely discerned within, being covered by the hill itself. Beyond these thirteen steps there was the distance of ten cubits; this was all plain; whence there were other steps, each of five cubits a Royce is still a human being with the mind of a sixteenth century tradesman. If you do not understand this at first, read it again. It will become clearer to you in a moment and it will explain many things that have happened these last six years. Perhaps I may give you another, more familiar, example, to show you what I mean. In the movie theatres, jokes and funny remarks are often thrown upon the screen. Watch the audience the next time you have a chance. A few people seem almost to inhale the words. It takes them but a second to read the lines. Others are a bit slower. Still others take from twenty to thirty seconds. Finally those men and women who do not read any more than they can help, get the point when the brighter ones among the audience have already begun to decipher the next cut tackle, and have the weather earing passed before there was a man upon the yard. In this way we were almost always able to raise the cry of &quot;Haul out to leeward&quot; before them, and having knotted our points, would slide down the shrouds and back reliefs, and its stupendous dome, a hundred and twenty feet in diameter; the mosque of the Sultan Solyman, forming an exact square with four noble towers at the angles, and with its huge cupola, in the midst; the mosque of the Sultan Ahmed, with its numerous domes, its tall minarets, and its colonnades supported by marble pillars; and the mosque of the Sultana Valida, or queen mother of Mohammed the Fourth, exceeding all other Mussulman churches in the delicacy of its architecture and the beauty of its columns of marble and jasper, supplied by the ruins of Troy&mdash;these are the most remarkable temples in the capital of the Ottoman empire. The Grand Bezestein, or exchange, is likewise a magnificent structure&mdash;consisting of a spacious hall of circular form, built of free &rdquo; asked Wagner. &ldquo;To remind thee of the advantages of that power which Faust, thy master, possessed, and which ceased to be available to thee when the term of his compact with myself arrived. Yes,&rdquo; continued the demon emphatically, &ldquo;the powers which he possessed may be possessed by thee&mdash;and thou may&rsquo;st, with a single word, at once and forever shake off the trammels of thy present doom&mdash;the doom of a Wehr But who gazes on that awful spectacle It&#39;s as funny as twins. Have to josh him about it when I see him, sure.&quot; But when Osterman and Magnus at last fell in with Annixter in the vestibule of the Lick House, on Montgomery Street, nothing could be got out of him. He was in an execrable humour. When Magnus had broached the subject of business, he had declared that all business could go to pot, and when Osterman, his tongue in his cheek, had permitted himself a most distant allusion to a feemale girl, Annixter had cursed him for a &quot;busy streets down to the margin of the waters of the Golden Horn. There a boat, in which two rowers and a female slave were seated, was waiting. &ldquo;Here, must you be blindfolded,&rdquo; said the spy. For a few moments Alessandro hesitated, in regret that he had gone so far with this adventure. He had heard fearful tales of dark deeds committed on the waters of the Bosporus and the Golden Horn; and he himself, when roving during his leisure hours along the verdant banks of those waters, had seen the livid corpse float with the tale &quot; He loosed her clasp and his eyes once more on Delaney, moved diagonally backwards toward the side of the barn, pushing Hilma from him. In the end he thrust her away so sharply that she gave back with a long stagger; somebody caught her arm and drew her in, leaving Annixter alone once more in the middle of the floor, his hands in his coat pockets, watchful, alert, facing his enemy. But the cow but as the dogs generally went in squads, there was seldom a fair fight. A smaller dog, belonging to us, once attacked a coati, single, and got a good deal worsted, and might perhaps have been killed had we not come to his assistance. We had, however, one dog which gave them a good deal of trouble, and many hard runs. He was a fine, tall fellow, and united strength and agility better than any dog that I have ever seen. He was born at the Islands, his father being an English mastiff, and his mother a greyhound. He had the high head, long legs, narrow body, and springing gait of the latter, and the heavy jaw, thick jowls, and strong fore his birth gave him ambition, the revolution independence; and, without changing his title, he reigned in peace from Sinope to the Phasis, along the coast of the Black Sea. His nameless son and successor ^ &rdquo; said Ibrahim, interrogatively. &ldquo;Such was the honorable office intrusted to me,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;When messengers from Villiers of Isle and pressed a thin hand to the back of his head. &quot;It is a nightmare,&quot; he murmured. &quot;A frightful nightmare, and it&#39;s not over yet. You have heard of it all only through the newspaper reports. But down there, at Bonneville, at Los Muertos and was looking for reinvestments in other lines when the news that &quot;wheat had been discovered in California&quot; was passed from mouth to mouth. Practically it amounted to a discovery. Dr. Glenn&#39;s first harvest of wheat in Colusa County, quietly undertaken but suddenly realised with dramatic abruptness, gave a new matter for reflection to the thinking men of the New West. California suddenly leaped unheralded into the world&#39;s market as a competitor in wheat production. In a few years her output of wheat exceeded the value of her out street. He also was well millionaire in the Comstock boom dressers, the gardeners, the water horses reined in by their riders. It was the first vessel that I had seen near, and I was surprised to find how much she rolled and pitched in so quiet a sea. She lunged her head into the sea, and then, her stern settling gradually down, her huge bows rose up, showing the bright copper, and her stern, and bresthooks dripping, like old Neptune&#39;s locks, with the brine. Her decks were filled with passengers who had come up at the cry of &quot;sail ho,&quot; and who by their dress and features appeared to be Swiss and French emigrants. She hailed us at first in French, but receiving no answer, she tried us in English. She was the ship La Carolina, from Havre, for New York. We desired her to report the brig Pilgrim, from Boston, for the north is not to be touched. Is it likely the ranchers would secure the election of a board that plays them false M.] [Footnote morrow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Her diamonds Mercy in Moreover, do the Arabians and Syrians now first of all begin to govern themselves as they please, and to indulge their appetites in a foreign war, and then, out of their barbarity in murdering men, and out of their hatred to the Jews, get it ascribed to the Romans stone to the gratification of his ambition. Thus by the time the boat touched the landing General Consequences Of The Crusades. After the death of the lawful princes, the French and Venetians, confident of justice and victory, agreed to divide and regulate their future possessions. ^1 It was stipulated by treaty, that twelve electors, six of either nation, should be nominated; that a majority should choose the emperor of the East; and that, if the votes were equal, the decision of chance should ascertain the successful candidate. To him, with all the titles and prerogatives of the Byzantine throne, they assigned the two palaces of Boucoleon and Blachernae, with a fourth part of the Greek monarchy. It was defined that the three remaining portions should be equally shared between the republic of Venice and the barons of France; that each feudatory, with an honorable exception for the doge, should acknowledge and perform the duties of homage and military service to the supreme head of the empire; that the nation which gave an emperor, should resign to their brethren the choice of a patriarch; and that the pilgrims, whatever might be their impatience to visit the Holy Land, should devote another year to the conquest and defence of the Greek provinces. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins, the treaty was confirmed and executed; and the first and most important step was the creation of an emperor. The six electors of the French nation were all ecclesiastics, the abbot of Loces, the archbishop elect of Acre in Palestine, and the bishops of Troyes, Soissons, Halberstadt, and Bethlehem, the last of whom exercised in the camp the office of pope&#39;s legate: their profession and knowledge were respectable; and as they could not be the objects, they were best qualified to be the authors of the choice. The six Venetians were the principal servants of the state, and in this list the noble families of Querini and Contarini are still proud to discover their ancestors. The twelve assembled in the chapel of the palace; and after the solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost, they proceeded to deliberate and vote. A just impulse of respect and gratitude prompted them to crown the virtues of the doge; his wisdom had inspired their enterprise; and the most youthful knights might envy and applaud the exploits of blindness and age. But the patriot Dandolo was devoid of all personal ambition, and fully satisfied that he had been judged worthy to reign. His nomination was overruled by the Venetians themselves: his countrymen, and perhaps his friends, ^2 represented, with the eloquence of truth, the mischiefs that might arise to national freedom and the common cause, from the union of two incompatible characters, of the first magistrate of a republic and the emperor of the East. The exclusion of the doge left room for the more equal merits of Boniface and Baldwin; and at their names all meaner candidates respectfully withdrew. The marquis of Montferrat was recommended by his mature age and fair reputation, by the choice of the adventurers, and the wishes of the Greeks; nor can I believe that Venice, the mistress of the sea, could be seriously apprehensive of a petty lord at the foot of the Alps. ^3 But the count of Flanders was the chief of a wealthy and warlike people: he was valiant, pious, and chaste; in the prime of life, since he was only thirty yarns. After we had done this, the boat went ashore with the captain, and returned with orders to the mate to send a boat ashore for him at sundown. I did not go in the first boat, and was glad to find that there was another going before night; for after so long a voyage as ours had been, a few hours is long to pass in sight and out of reach of land. We spent the day on board in the usual avocations; but as this was the first time we had been without the captain, we felt a little more freedom, and looked about us to see what sort of a country we had got into, and were to spend a year or two of our lives in. In the first place, it was a beautiful day, and so warm that we had on straw hats, duck trowsers, and all the summer gear; and as this was mid until at last after a warning rumble and the scraping of many wheels a thunderous voice, high above us, told the world that it was the hour of noon. On the next floor were the bells. The nice little bells and their terrible sisters. In the centre the big bell, which made me turn stiff with fright when I heard it in the middle of the night telling a story of fire or flood. In solitary grandeur it seemed to reflect upon those six hundred years during which it had shared the joys and the sorrows of the good people of Rotterdam. Around it, neatly arranged like the blue jars in an old &rdquo; repeated the marquis: &ldquo;much&mdash;everything, old man But I must torture ere I slay ye &quot; she questioned. With a movement of infinite tenderness and affection she slid her arms around his neck, still crying a little. The sensation of her warm body in his embrace, the feeling of her smooth, round arm, through the thinness of her sleeve, pressing against his cheek, thrilled Annixter with a delight such as he had never known. He bent his head and kissed her upon the nape of her neck, where the delicate amber tint melted into the thick, sweet smelling mass of her dark brown hair. She shivered a little, holding him closer, ashamed as yet to look up. Without speech, they stood there for a long minute, holding each other close. Then Hilma pulled away from him, mopping her tear west; but we were not yet far enough to the southward to make a fair wind of it, for we must give Terra del Fuego a wide berth. The decks were covered with snow, and there was a constant driving of sleet. In fact, Cape Horn had set in with good earnest. In the midst of all this, and before it became dark, we had all the studding ninth chapter of Job, and a few other passages from Scripture. The next in the order, that I never varied from, came Cowper&#39;s Castaway, which was a great favorite with me; the solemn measure and gloomy character of which, as well as the incident that it was founded upon, made it well suited to a lonely watch at sea. Then his lines to Mary, his address to the jackdaw, and a short extract from Table Talk; (I abounded in Cowper, for I happened to have a volume of his poems in my chest;) &quot;Ille et nefasto&quot; from Horace, and Goethe&#39;s Erl King. After I had got through these, I allowed myself a more general range among everything that I could remember, both in prose and verse. In this way, with an occasional break by relieving the wheel, heaving the log, and going to the scuttle &#39;vast &quot; With this and the like matter, equally calculated to quiet us, and to allay any apprehensions of future trouble, he entertained us for about ten minutes, when he went below. Soon after, John came aft, with his bare back covered with stripes and wales in every direction, and dreadfully swollen, and asked the steward to ask the captain to let him have some salve, or balsam, to put upon it. &quot;No,&quot; said the captain, who heard him from below; &quot;tell him to put his shirt on; that&#39;s the best thing for him; and pull me ashore in the boat. Nobody is going to lay And now the moon rises with unclouded splendor, like a maiden looking from her lattice screened with purple curtains; and still the monster hurries madly on with unrelaxing speed. For hours has he pursued his way thus madly; and, on a sudden, as he passes the outskirts of a sleeping town, the church &quot; said they, as soon as they saw us; and we went down, and found a large, high forecastle, well lighted; and a crew of twelve or fourteen men, eating out of their kids and pans, and drinking their tea, and talking and laughing, all as independent and easy as so many &quot;wood &quot; &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll have a lay cannot the reader conceive the anguish, the mortal anguish, she had ere now endured when her husband was heaping ashes on the reputation of her lover &quot; &quot;I think he is a wicked man,&quot; she declared. &quot;I know the Railroad has pretended to sell him part of the ranch, and he lets Mr. S. Behrman and Mr. Ruggles just use him.&quot; &quot;Right. I thought you wouldn&#39;t be keen on him.&quot; There was a long pause. The buckskin began blowing among the pebbles, nosing for grass, and Annixter shifted his cigar to the other corner of his mouth. &quot;Pretty place,&quot; he muttered, looking around him. Then he added: &quot;Miss Hilma, see here, I want to have a kind of talk with you, if you don&#39;t mind. I don&#39;t know just how to say these sort of things, and if I get all balled up as I go along, you just set it down to the fact that I&#39;ve never had any experience in dealing with feemale girls; understand stays, standing parts of the lifts, the ties, runners, etc., and go out to the yard gallant How did she manage to keep them hid on ordinary occasions. Big at the shoulder, tapering with delicious modulations to the elbow and wrist, overlaid with a delicate, gleaming lustre. As often as she turned her head the movement sent a slow undulation over her neck and shoulders, the pale amber the listlessness of great fatigue. &quot;Well, well,&quot; observed the other. &quot;I&#39;m right sorry to hear that. What&#39;s the trouble, Pres save me For I could not live without you; and most unjust should I be, most unworthy of the name of a man, if I were to allow a contemptible prejudice to stand in the way of my happiness.&rsquo; &ldquo;She returned no answer, but the rapidity of her breathing and the ill subdued sobs which interrupted her respiration at short intervals, convinced me that a fierce struggle was taking place within her bosom. For it was now quite dark and I could not see her face; the hand, however, which I held clasped in my own, trembled violently. &ldquo;&lsquo;Beautiful maiden,&rsquo; I said after a long pause, &lsquo;wherefore do you not reply to me yes, I do not doubt, forever chamber felt the ground shake beneath their feet; the sides&mdash;although hollowed from the solid rock&mdash;appeared to vibrate and groan, and the aperture leading into the subterrane of the convent was closed up by the massive masonry that had fallen in. Flora and Giulia threw themselves into each other&rsquo;s arms, weeping bitterly; for they saw how dearly their freedom had been purchased, and they trembled for the result. But the Marquis of Orsini, although greatly shocked at the terrible sacrifice of human life which had occurred, exerted himself to console and reassure the two terrified ladies. CHAPTER XXXIII. LOMELLINO&rsquo;S ESCAPE&mdash;STEPHANO&rsquo;S INTENTIONS. Stephano Verrina was not the man to allow his energies to be paralyzed by the reverse he had just sustained. He immediately commanded a general muster of his men to be held in the banqueting r &quot; The group turned and fixed her to like a young fury. &quot;Hurrah in the bow This was doing the business on a great scale. Standing on the edge of the hill and looking down the perpendicular height, the sailors, effendi discovered that the Florentine envoy had condescended to avail himself of the brilliant talents of his secretary, Alessandro Francatelli, to infuse spirit into his official notes. The reis a wise policy to increase the patrician order in proportion to the general increase of the nation.</div>
