<p><b style="font: 10px Segoe MDL2 Assets; color: #2727dd;">To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn&#39;t quite go as expected.He loved eating his bananas in hot dog buns.Flesh-colored yoga pants were far worse than even he feared.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.He created a pig burger out of beef.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone whispering into a cell .On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?Mom didn&rsquo;t understand why no one else wanted a hot tub full of jello.You have no right to yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a lockpick.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.The door slammed on the watermelon.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.I am my aunt&#39;s sister&#39;s daughter.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.In that instnt, everything changed.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy everyone.Be careful with that butter knife.The old apple revels in its authority.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.He had reached the point where he was paranoid about being paranoid.She looked into the mirror and saw another person.Two more days and his problems would be solved.</b></p>
