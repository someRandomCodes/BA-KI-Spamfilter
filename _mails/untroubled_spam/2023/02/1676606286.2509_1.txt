			<p><b style="font: 0.05px Tahoma; color: #646D7E;">She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of gold, Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.People who insist on picking their teeth with their elbows are so annoying!It was her first experience training a rainbow unicorn.They&#39;re playing the piano while flying in the plane.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.Chocolate covered crickets were his favorite snack.He loved eating his bananas in hot dog buns.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.The thunderous roar of the jet overhead confirmed her worst fears.Random words in front of other random words create a random sentence.Having no hair made him look even hairier.She found his complete dullness interesting.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.He drank life before spitting it out.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.I checked to make sure that he was still alive.With a single flip of the coin, his life changed forever.They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the lady&rsquo;s bag of food.He took one look at what was under the table and noped the hell out of there.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.We have never been to Asia, nor have we visited Africa.He realized there had been several deaths on this road, but his concern rose when he saw the exact number.He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but only she could make herself happy.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in order to be with her.The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.She was the type of girl who wanted to live in a pink house.He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.She moved forward only because she trusted that the ending she now was going through must be followed by a new beginning.In that instant, everything changed.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.Sometimes you have to just give up and win by cheating.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.Improve your goldfish&#39;s physical fitness by getting him a bicycle.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.Nobody loves a pig wearing lipstick.</b></p>
