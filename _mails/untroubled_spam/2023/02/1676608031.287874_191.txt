<p><b style="font: 5px Brushstroke; color: #dd2727;">I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realThe skeleton had skeletons of his own in the closet.Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.There are over 500 starfish in the bathroom drawer.She had convinced her kids that any mushroom found on the ground would kill them if they touched it.He created a pig burger out of beef.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to milk.I&rsquo;m a living furnace.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.You can&#39;t apples and oranges, but what about bananas and plantains?I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin.There&#39;s no reason a hula hoop can&#39;t also be a circus ring.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.Imagine his surprise when he discovered that the safe was full of pudding.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.The knives were out and she was sharpening hers.He played the game as if his depended on it and the truth was that it did.I used to practice weaving with spaghetti three hours a day but stopped because I didn&#39;t want to die alone.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.Hit me with your pet shark!She folded her handkerchief neatly.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.Twin 4-month-olds slept in the shade of the palm tree while the mother tanned in the sun.I think I will the red car, or I will lease the blue one.I&#39;m not a party animal, but I do like animal parties.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.</b></p>
