other squadrons, were equipped with CS gas, stun grenades, and explosives and armed with Browning Hi-Power pistols and Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns.[note 4] Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rose, commander of 22 SAS, had travelled ahead of the detachment and introduced himself to Dellow, the commander of the police operation. At approximately 03:30 on 1 May, one of the SAS teams moved into the building next door to the embassy, normally occupied by the Royal College of General Practitioners, where they were briefed on Rose's "immediate action" plan, to be implemented should the SAS be required to storm the building before a more sophisticated plan could be formed.

Early in the morning of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to telephone the BBC's news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, appeared to become seriously ill. He and three other non-Arab hostages had decided one of them must get out, and to do this, he had convincingly exaggerated the symptoms of an existing illness. His colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.

As the deadline of noon approached, set the previous day for the release of the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have th

<div style="width:600px;font-size:17px;font-family:cambria;padding:15px;text-align-left;">I just got this.<br />
<br />
A team of scientists from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has finally discovered the real reason <a href="http://keragenis.today/TrVUhHzAck7MLNtZLjAjsAgmEgY-sZCCBvZ8zXHrqbBBIEm0eg" target="blank"><b>why you&rsquo;ve been losing your vision.</b></a><br />
<br />
They urge people to look over this report TODAY, as it also unveils how to restore 2020 vision in less than a few weeks.<br />
<br />
<b>Yes, this is finally happening!</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://keragenis.today/TrVUhHzAck7MLNtZLjAjsAgmEgY-sZCCBvZ8zXHrqbBBIEm0eg" target="blank"><img src="http://keragenis.today/4734fc6fb1dbc331e8.png" /></a><br />
<br />
<b>And so far it has helped thousands of Americans.</b><br />
<br />
But, as the authors say, this research will be taken off the internet very soon.<br />
<br />
So if you or someone you love has been losing their vision,<a href="http://keragenis.today/TrVUhHzAck7MLNtZLjAjsAgmEgY-sZCCBvZ8zXHrqbBBIEm0eg" target="blank"><b style="color:red;">don&rsquo;t miss this</b></a> while it&rsquo;s still live on the internet.</div>
