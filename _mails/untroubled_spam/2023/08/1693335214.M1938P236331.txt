The ExtraCare Rewards program is designed to give back to our most loyal customers.  By shopping regularly at CVS, you can accumulate points that translate into real savings.  Points can be earned on a multitude of products across our store locations, making it one of the most flexible rewards programs in the retail industry. 

We also strive to create personalized offers through our advanced analytics algorithms.  By tracking your purchases, we are able to send you specific deals on the items you love.  From over-the-counter medicines to toiletries and snacks, we want to make your shopping experience as rewarding as possible. 

Beyond individual rewards, the ExtraCare program also provides opportunities for community giving.  By using your ExtraCare card, you can opt to donate a portion of your savings to local charities, adding a philanthropic aspect to your retail experience.  It's our way of saying thank you for being not just a customer, but also a community member. 

Our ExtraCare program is not just about the points; it's about making your shopping experience worthwhile.  Special in-store events, exclusive online offers, and members-only perks are just some of the additional benefits you'll enjoy.  We aim to continually evolve the program to meet your needs and welcome any feedback you may have. 

One thing to note: while the ExtraCare program is free to join, its important to keep your account information up to date to make sure you're getting the most out of it.  Failing to update your information may result in lost points or expired rewards, so it's a good idea to occasionally check in on your account status. 

Lastly, we take your privacy seriously.  All data collected through the ExtraCare program is stored securely and will never be sold to third parties.  Your trust is paramount to us, and we employ robust security measures to protect your information. 

Thank you for being a valued CVS customer.  We look forward to continuing to serve you through our ExtraCare program and other in-store services.
