I'm a fan but I'm not sure how much of a fan? The farmers' style ceviche is=
 superb.  I immediately had echoes to my last visit to Peru, and that is sa=
ying something.  The tropical style ceviche was good but didn't work quite =
as well.  Might simply be a style preference, this one almost made me want =
to slurp up the cantaloupe puree it was composed of (delish!) but the flavo=
rs itself didn't appeal quite as much with the seafood.  Lomo saltado was a=
lso deemed quite good.  Arroz con mariscos tho. . .  a bit too soggy? The o=
nly real miss.  Outdoor seating was nice but service was a bit erratic, plu=
s they had some tables reserved so they wouldn't let us sit there (reasonab=
le), but then no other guests actually showed up and they had removed the r=
eserved marker when we left? A bit odd.  Perhaps COVID-19 safety but then t=
hey already had high plexiglass dividers between the tables, so maybe regul=
ations changed and we missed the change? I am now a fan of Peruvian food af=
ter eating here.  This place offers unique dishes with contrasts of flavor.=
  The place is tiny, only able to fit about 15 people inside, so you may ha=
ve to wait but trust me. . .  It will be worth it.  Whenever I try ethnic f=
oods I like to try a dish that is as authentic as possible to the native fl=
avors.  The owner was Peruvian, so I asked what the most authentic dishes w=
ere and she suggested ANTICUCHOS or the CEVICHE.  The anticuchos is beef he=
art but don't let that scare you.  It was amazing! You'd think it would be =
tough and have a distinct taste.  It was actually really tender and so flav=
orful.  Served with salsa croillo ( seasoned onions and tomatoes) and the d=
ipping sauce really balanced the flavors.  I recommend this! This is like a=
n entree size portion too mind you.  Now the CEVICHE.  It was bright and re=
freshing! Perfect contrast to other heavier dishes.  It was a good mix of s=
eafood; squid, shrimp, scallops, and muscles.  The owner is friendly and de=
lightful and won't be shy to chat with you.  Great family run Peruvian spot=
 that's low key in Culver City.  Definitely get one of the ceviches, I'd sa=
y that was definitely the best dish and probably Lonzo's specialty.  Got a =
Peruvian seafood paella for free with OTM and that was good as well.  The f=
ilet mignon lomo saltado was the only minor letdown with the beef being sli=
ghtly over cooked and a tad too salty.  Would've also preferred the filet t=
o be cut in strips and not cubed.  I'd say get the ribeye one maybe to be s=
afer.  Passion fruit juice is good as well if you want something to drink.=
