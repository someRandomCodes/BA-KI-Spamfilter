For high-church Anglicans, doctrine is neither established by a magisterium, nor derived from the theology of an eponymous founder (such as Calvinism), nor summed up in a confession of faith beyond the ecumenical creeds (such as the Lutheran Book of Concord). For them, the earliest Anglican theological documents are its prayer books, which they see as the products of profound theological reflection, compromise, and synthesis. They emphasise the Book of Common Prayer as a key expression of Anglican doctrine. The principle of looking to the prayer books as a guide to the parameters of belief and practice is called by the Latin name lex orandi, lex credendi ("the law of prayer is the law of belief").

Within the prayer books are the fundamentals of Anglican doctrine: the Apostles' and Nicene creeds, the Athanasian Creed (now rarely used), the scriptures (via the lectionary), the sacraments, daily prayer, the catechism, and apostolic succession in the context of the historic threefold ministry. For some low-church and evangelical Anglicans, the 16th-century Reformed Thirty-Nine Articles form the basis of doctr

<div style="width:500px;font-family:helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:20px; text-align:left;">Most of us like to partake in a little vino, a cocktail, or a nice cold brewski every now and then&hellip;<br />
<br />
And I&rsquo;m one of them :)<br />
<br />
However, recent studies prove the #1 sign you drink too much is excess lower belly fat (also referred to as &lsquo;Liver Belly&rsquo;).<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s because the entire fat-burning process depends on a healthy liver.<br />

And although alcohol is normally quite damaging to your liver&hellip;<br />

The ancient Mediterranean ritual you&rsquo;ll see at the link below naturally protects, purifies, and rapidly cleanses your liver of EVERY form of alcohol&hellip;<br />

<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:5px;">Anglicanism was seen as a middle way, or via media, between two branches of Protestantism, Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity. In their rejection of absolute parliamentary authority, the Tractarians &ndash; and in particular John Henry Newman &ndash; looked back to the writings of 17th-century Anglican divines, finding in these texts the idea of the English church as a via media between the Protestant and Catholic traditions. This view was associated &ndash; especially in the writings of Edward Bouverie Pusey &ndash; with the theory of Anglicanism as one of three &quot;branches&quot; (alongside the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church) historically arising out of the common tradition of the earliest ecumenical councils. Newman himself subsequently rejected his theory of the via media, as essentially historicist and static and hence unable to accommodate any dynamic development within the church. Nevertheless, the aspiration to ground Anglican identity in the writings of the 17th-century divines and in faithfulness to the traditions of the Church Fathers reflects a continuing theme of Anglican ecclesiology, most recently in the writings of Henry Robert McAdoo. The Tractarian formulation of the theory of the via media between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism was essentially a party platform, and not acceptable to Anglicans outside the confines of the Oxford Movement. However, this theory of the via media was reworked in the ecclesiological writings of Frederick Denison Maurice, in a more dynamic form that became widely influentia</span><br />
