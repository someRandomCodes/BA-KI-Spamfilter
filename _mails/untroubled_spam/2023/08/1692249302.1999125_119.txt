Have you ever tried to create a Text to Speech (TTS) audio file, and thought, That was easy?

Even, That sounds great!

Nope, didn't think so.

Let’s face it up until now creating Text To Speech audio has been a PAIN…

And the results?

Just plain disapointing!

Sure, you could outsource your Voiceovers and pay several hundred bucks for an “average” Voice Over… not to mention the time and hassle of going back and forth with a bunch of freelancers.

But what if there was a much easier, faster way to create Human Sounding audio in a few clicks… in MINUTES from now?!

You’re in luck, because there’s a brand new tool that’s just hit the market called Speechelo, and it’s going to make your life INFINITELY easier when it comes to creating Voice-oers from Text

Expensive Freelancers
Forget Robotic TTS Tools
Forget disapointing results

Now you can get the ultimate edge over the competition, slash hours off your day, and pump out Human sounding Audio for your videos in double quick time.

PS. This NEW software will create Voice-overs that sound ‘Human’ I’ve never heard anything like it
















The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum next received an NFL team in 1982, when the Oakland Raiders moved to Los Angeles to become the Los Angeles Raiders. Team owner Al Davis relocated there without the approval of his fellow owners or NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle. One major factor for Davis in moving to the Coliseum—despite its flaws as a football stadium—was his assumption that the NFL would eventually approve pay-per-view telecasts for its games; such a move would potentially have given the Raiders a virtual TV monopoly in Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest TV market. Davis also counted on being able to persuade the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission to renovate the facility, particularly by installing scores of luxury boxes. The UCLA Bruins relocated their home to the Rose Bowl Stadium in response to the Raiders' arrival.[7] The Raiders continued the success they had in Oakland after the move south, winning Super Bowl XVIII in January 1984—which was the only Super Bowl-winning team under the city of Los Angeles until 2022—and reaching the AFC Championship Game in the 1990 season. But the team gained a controversial reputation off the field, as its silver and black colors became associated with L.A.'s notorious street gangs. More importantly, the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission never gave Davis the lucrative package of amenities he had been promised, and the NFL's broadcast contracts never instituted pay-per-view. Additionally, due to concerns about the area around Exposition Park and the Raiders' difficulty in selling out their home games (resulting in television blackouts in Los Angeles), the NFL scheduled all of the Raiders' appearances on Monday Night Football as road games after 1985,[8] and would not even consider letting them play Monday night games in Anaheim. Eventually, Davis lost patience and entertained an offer from Irwindale, California (east of downtown L.A.) in 1987, but did not move there
