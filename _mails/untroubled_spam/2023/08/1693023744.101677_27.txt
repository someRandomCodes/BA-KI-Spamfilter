g in shows like "Friends," "ER," and "The Sopranos. " These series blurred =
the lines between episodic and continuous narratives, captivating viewers a=
nd prompting discussions about character development and plot intricacies. =
 As the 2000s dawned, the landscape of television series underwent further =
