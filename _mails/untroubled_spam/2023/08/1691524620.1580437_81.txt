Prior to 1980, London had been the scene of several terrorist incidents related to Middle East politics, including the assassination of the former prime minister of the Republic of Yemen, and an attack on a coach containing staff from the Israeli airline El Al. Although there were other isolated incidents relating to Middle Eastern and North African politics in the years following the embassy siege, most prominently the murder of Yvonne Fletcher from inside the Libyan embassy in 1984, historian Jerry White believed the resolution of the siege "effectively marked the end of London's three years as a world theatre for the resolution of Middle Eastern troubles".

The SAS raid, codenamed "Operation Nimrod", was broadcast live at peak time on a bank holiday Monday evening and was viewed by millions of people, mostly in the UK, making it a defining moment in British history. Both the BBC and ITV interrupted their scheduled programming, the BBC interrupting the broadcast of the World Snooker Championship final, to show the end of the siege, which proved to be a major career boost for several journalists. Kate Adie, the BBC's duty reporter at the embassy when the SAS assault began, went on to cover Nejad's trial and then to report from war zones across the world and eventually to become chief news correspondent for BBC News, while David Goldsmith and his team, responsible for the hidden camera at the back of the embassy, were awarded a BAFTA for their coverage. The success of the operation, combined with the high profile it was given by the media, invoked a sense of national pride compared to Victory in Europe Day, the end of the Second World War in Europe. The operation was declared "an almost unqualified success". Margaret Thatcher recalled that she was congratulated wherever she went over the following days, and received messages of support and congratulation from other world leaders. However, the incident strained already-tense relations between the UK and Iran following the Iranian Revolution. The Iranian government declared that the siege of the embassy was planned by the British and American governments, and that the hostages who had been killed were martyrs for the Revolutio

</center>
Let&rsquo;s start with what we all know, a clean and tidy home is great for many things, <b>improved mood, health, and positive energy.</b><br />
<br />
<b>Regular cleaning </b>and vacuuming helps to take care of this by removing dirt, dust, and other particles around your home, preventing the buildup of allergens, pollutants and worse of all, <a href="http://ignitez.ltd/2Nr7Achb4DkB8ibZPuds_aZA82ZL6Q_i1s2-UiO2oRBJzrDM" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank">virus causing germs.</a><br />

<br />
<br />
This causes problems, as these areas collect debris that isn&#39;t always visible to the naked eye.<br />
<br />
Think pet hair, grime, dust, and even worse, harmful germs.<br />
<br />
Say goodbye to germs, bulky vacuums, and tiresome cleaning sessions, because this vacuum actually turns hoovering into quite a satisfying activity. <a href="http://ignitez.ltd/2Nr7Achb4DkB8ibZPuds_aZA82ZL6Q_i1s2-UiO2oRBJzrDM" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank">We never thought we&rsquo;d be saying this!</a><br />
