removed. In KM service their official crew numbered 19, but as they were training ships this was supplemented with instructors and students, and shortly before the Axis invasion in April 1941 the complement was increased to 40. After delivery they were fitted with two Å koda 90 mm (3.5 in) L/45 guns. These were surplus Austro-Hungarian Navy guns that had been intended for mounting on ships that were incomplete at the end of World War I. The guns had been sent to Pula and the Bay of Kotor as coastal artillery, and they were seized by the Serbian Army as the war ended, and thus avoided being acquired by the occupying French forces. These guns weighed 1,180 kg (2,600 lb) each, and when combined with their mount they weighed 3,910 kg (8,620 lb). The shells weighed 10.2 kg (22 lb), and they could be fired at a rate of between three and eleven per minute to a maximum range of 12,300 m (40,400 ft). From the time they were re-armed until the Hrabri-class submarines joined the navy in 1928, the ships of the Galeb class had the most powerful guns in the Yugoslav fleet. The ships were also equipped with two Zbrojovka Brno 15 mm (0.59 in) ZB-60 anti-aircraft machineguns. Sources vary on the number of naval mines that could be carried by the ships while in Yugoslav service, with sources stating either 24 or 30.

In 1931, at least four ships of the class had their guns re-lined to 83.5 mm (3.29 in) to use the same ammunition as the dual-purpose guns fitted to the Yugoslav light cruiser Dalmacija. The remainder were fitted with new guns in the same calibre. The combined gun and mount weighed 4,500 kg (9,900 lb). The shells weighed 10 kg (22 lb), and the guns could be fired at a rate of twelve per minute, to a maximum range of 17,000 m (56,000 ft) and a vertical height of 12,000 m (39,000 ft).

In Yugoslav Navy service following World War II, the engines of the surviving ship were rated at 1,600 indicated horsepower (1,200 kW) and her top speed remained 15 kn. With a load of 130 t (130 long tons) of coal, she achieved a range of 1,350 nmi (2,500 km; 1,550 mi) at 15 kn and 1,516 nmi (2,808 km; 1,745 mi) at 8 kn (15 km/h; 9.2 mph). Her crew was increas
