My mother and I were in LA for the week and decided to try Lonzo's based on=
 the reviews.  My mother is Peruvian and she loves to try Peruvian restaura=
nts.  We excited based on the positive reviews and the ease of finding stre=
et parking.  Unfortunately, the hostess or the woman in charge that night l=
acked customer service.  She was rude and dismissive to my mother.  We unde=
rstood there may not be an option to be seated given how small the restaura=
nt is but when my mom asked if there was a menu for take out, the lady was =
dismissive and told my mom she had to help someone else and then ignored he=
r completely.  This was all in Spanish.  It was incredibly disappointing to=
 be treated so poorly by the restaurant's staff.  It not only reflects poor=
ly on the restaurant but also gives a poor impression of our culture to any=
one who witnesses an uncalled for treatment.  I have cousins that live in t=
he area, and after sharing our experience, we will definitely not return or=
 recommend this Peruvian restaurant to our friends in the LA area.  May I b=
e a bit selfish and ask you please not come to Lonzo's? The place has such =
the sweet and charming atmosphere and delicious Peruvian fare I don't want =
to have to fight my way through to enjoy! :D All kidding aside, what a gem =
of a place!! Located on Washington Blvd, you can actually drive by this pla=
ce and pass right by, hidden in plain sight as it were.  Love the service r=
eceived, starting from Justo our server and Miriam the owner.  One of the b=
est ceviche I've ever tasted (Mango!!) and chicha fresca was delectable, su=
rprisingly enjoyed the papa a la huacaina, which was a new experience for m=
e.  Price was on par with the generous portion received, actually had even =
enough for a leftover to take home.  There is something about this place so=
 quaint and magical, loved the hand painted birds! My friends and I enjoyed=
 our time there and still thinking about it since our pre-COVID visit.  I'v=
e been craving it and when I'm back in town will be certain to visit again!=
 Came here a few years ago with my mom when this little place was was still=
 called Lonzo's bakery and I loved the lomo saltado, so after moving back t=
o the westside I thought it was time for a repeat visit.  The ceviche here =
is SO good.  I tried the one at ceviche stop a few weeks ago and I have to =
say this one beats it out.  The lomo saltado was good as well, it's really =
hard to go wrong with a good lomo saltado.  I just wish it was a bit saucie=
r! The arroz con mariscos was a bit of a miss for me.  It was missing some =
kind of strong flavor to make it a "wow" dish, but it sure looked pretty!
