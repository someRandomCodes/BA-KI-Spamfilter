Thorburn was born on 16 January 1948 in Victoria, British Columbia. His parents separated when he was eighteen months old.: 104  He was abandoned by his mother, and after spending about two years in an orphanage during a custody dispute, was raised by his father and his paternal grandmother. He was told that his mother had died, but, aged twenty, learnt that she was still alive.

He played pool and lacrosse in his youth, and set a one-game scoring record of ten goals in the Greater Victoria Minor Lacrosse Association "midget division" in 1958. He left school at the age of 16, and travelled across Canada playing pool and snooker money matches, taking jobs as a dishwasher and working on a garbage truck to help earn money for his stakes. In 1968 he entered his first tournaments, and won the Toronto City Championship. He spent time with Fred Davis and Rex Williams when they toured Canada in 1970, and afterwards became a resident professional at the House of Champions club in Toronto.

In July 1970, he reportedly made a maximum break of 147 in a non-competitive game against Fred Hardwick. He made six century breaks in winning the North American Amateur Championship in 1971, equalling the record, jointly held by Joe Davis and George Chenier, for most century breaks in a single tourn

<p>Hi,</p>

<p><a href="http://myboostaro.shop/DZgcAr3eb72PQBKdJA_QarhDEG3H3wYlYT6IXiCwBKIBo_Hj" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="color:#05007f;font-weight:bold;" target="blank">Have you seen this?</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Dr. Kara&rsquo;s simple way to get the energy you need from fruits and vegetables&hellip; without eating them!</p>

<p>After 30+ years of research and working with patients&hellip;</p>

<p>Dr. Kara knows it&rsquo;s virtually <em><b>impossible</b> </em>to get the nutrients you need from today&rsquo;s fruits and vegetables.</p>

<ul>
	<li>And what&rsquo;s worse:</li>
	<li>Most fruits &amp; veggies are full of toxic herbicides and pesticides&hellip;</li>
	<li>Industrial Farming is stripping the nutrients from our soils and food&hellip;</li>
	<li>And by the time &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; produce gets from transit, to store shelves, and onto your table, it barely has any nutrients left!</li>
	<li>This means the fruits &amp; vegetables you eat not only LACK the energy you need&hellip;</li>
	<li>They could even be making you sick.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Dr. Kara created, <a href="http://myboostaro.shop/DZgcAr3eb72PQBKdJA_QarhDEG3H3wYlYT6IXiCwBKIBo_Hj" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="color:#05007f;font-weight:bold;" target="blank">Pure Nature.</a></p>

<p>20 of the highest-quality fruits and vegetables you can find all packed into 1 potent capsule&hellip;.</p>

<p>Making it the easiest way to get the energy you need from fresh produce&hellip; in just 10 seconds a day!</p>

<p>And the benefits are life-changing. Here&rsquo;s what 80-year-old, Karen Z., had to say:</p>
<b>&quot;I can definitely tell a difference in the amount of energy I feel. I highly recommend this for anyone who feels sleepy in the afternoon!&quot; </b>

<p>And Kevin L., who wrote:</p>
<b> &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve started taking Pure Nature, I&rsquo;ve noticed a huge difference in the quality of my life. I wake up feeling refreshed, I&rsquo;m sleeping better, and I finally have the energy I need to push through my day!&rdquo; </b>

<p>Pure Nature is also non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, vegan friendly&hellip; and contains no added sugars, fillers, preservatives, synthetics, or added sweeteners of any kind.</p>
<b> And the best part? </b>

<p>Pure Nature delivers the daily nutrients you need from just 4 capsules&hellip;</p>

<p>Which means you&#39;ll have more energy than you can remember... without eating 20 fruits or vegetables a day!</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone who struggles with low energy&hellip;</p>

<p>The type that keeps you from doing what you love&hellip; falling behind your colleagues at work&hellip; or barely keeping up with the ones you love&hellip;</p>
