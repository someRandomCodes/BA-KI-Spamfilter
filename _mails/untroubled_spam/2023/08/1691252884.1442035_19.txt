ile we were trying to leave Ukraine through Kiev, I was rescued alive but I=
 am trapped back here in Oblast of Lviv where I am receiving treatments, I =
just need an urgent assistance from you, My husband as a prominent politici=
an and a businessman have some funds in million euro in a turkish Financi b=
ank, It belongs to my late husband and I am the next of kin, we were saving=
 the funds for his election in 2024. It is true that I do not know you, but=
 I have confidence that you will not disappoint me. I offer to pay you %10 =
of the funds and the rest of the funds you will invest for me in your compa=
ny's production/business because when I recover, I would want to be exporti=
