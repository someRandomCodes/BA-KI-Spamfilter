I've been to Lonzo's before for their baked goods (the chocolate pan was re=
ally good) and their lobster nachos (also very satisfying and abundant).  T=
his was my first dinner with them.  Parking: Easy street parking at night (=
I believe it's free after 6).  BYOB/W: Yes you can bring your own libations=
 to the restaurant.  You can run down to the Ralph's down the street in cas=
e you forgot.  Space/Seating: One good thing that came out of the pandemic =
was they added an outdoor patio on part of the street for additional seatin=
g.  Tbh given the popularity I'm surprised they haven't ventured into a big=
ger space.  For 2 people we only waited less than 5 minutes, but I suggest =
making a reso for bigger parties (4-6 max in my opinion) via online or phon=
e.  Food: Seriously everything was good and I was surprised by how many ite=
ms were on the menu! I was a little bothered by the higher pricing but when=
 I saw the dishes come out I can tell it was pretty high quality.  We order=
ed 2 appetizers (ceviche and anticuchos/beef heart) and 2 entrees (arroz co=
n mariscos and lomo saltado with filet mignon).  We also got the chicha dri=
nk which was very sweet and big enough to share if you just want to taste i=
n between bites.  In total, we spent about $100.  The ceviche was very fres=
h and citrusy.  I wish it came with chips though.  The beef hearts came wit=
h sauce and potatoes and salsa, make sure to put all items on your fork for=
 the perfect bite! The hubs got the arroz con mariscos and it was elegantly=
 presented in a molcajete.  It was a perfect combination of rice and seafoo=
d (shrimp, scallops, mussels, squid etc).  For my saltado, I ordered my ste=
ak medium rare but it came out to just over a medium well, but I didn't min=
d so much because the sauce and rice and fries were so delicious! Thank you=
 for the great meal! Pro tip: make a reservation!! Lonzo's looks low-key.  =
If it's empty when you walk up and notice a bunch of 'reserved' tent placar=
ds, it's not to fool you--the restaurant gets packed and others beat you to=
 it! The Peruvian food is delicious, the seafood is really fresh, and the p=
rawns are ginormous.  My favorite dish by far was the ceviche mixto--differ=
ent types of seafood swimming in a creamy yellow acidic concoction that was=
 bright and acidic.  We also got a seafood saltado, which was not greasy an=
d heavy.  I wasn't too excited about the Parmesan Scallops, which were on a=
 half shell.  There was so much parm that it overpowered the scallop and it=
 hardened too quickly while dining outdoors.  I also wish the aji verde sau=
ce was spicier like Mario's Peruvian.  I would definitely return again--sta=
ff is friendly and there are so many other dishes I can't wait to try.  Fin=
al pro tip: it's BYOB so pick up a bottle of wine or 6-pack before heading =
over.=20
