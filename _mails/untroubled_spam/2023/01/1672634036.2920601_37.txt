Freezing to death was the least of 19-year-old Ben’s worries when he left home for the University of ND after Christmas break.
http://www.folifort.email/l/lt11JK10874YI99XD/4902LD7120HL8747J14K33995UT392081294
The forecast was bitter cold and a small chance of snow… nothing scary for the average midwesterner with 4WD and a full tank of gas.

But as temperatures dropped to -2º, the oil in Ben’s car started to thicken… causing his engine to give out on an utterly barren stretch of I29.

Meanwhile, a “small chance of snow” turned into an 8-10” winter storm.

Ben called for help, but rescuers were still at least 2 hours from him given the conditions.

The temperature inside his car started dropping fast… then his body temperature started dropping as well.

Thankfully Ben’s mom was smart enough to tuck this Emergency Sleeping Bag in his glove box.

Within minutes the Emergency Sleeping Bag brought his core body temperature back up -- and kept it there for hours until help finally arrived.

That’s because these miracle survival tools trap 90% of your body heat and reflect it back to you.

the Emergency Sleeping Bag is the most underrated survival tool of all time.

And today you can get one 50% OFF.

Here’s why.

First off, temperatures are still warm in many places right now, and while we sell these at a steady clip in the winter… sales are slower in warmer months.

So, we need to get them off the shelves.

Secondly, we're about to redo the logo on our Emergency Sleeping Bag.

And to clear out the product inventory of the non-logo version we're going to give them away 50% OFF to whoever wants one.

Hurry and claim yours NOW. We only have a few hundred left. And as this email is going to 87,551 other customers they're sure to fly off the shelf!

50% OFF here -(while supplies last).

P.S. The Emergency Sleeping Bag is tiny. And many people own a few for their car, home, go bag and more.

Yes you can get one for 50% OFF at the link above, but you can also get a ton of them for an even bigger discount on this page as well.
