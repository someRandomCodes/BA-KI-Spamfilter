The final, between Cliff Thorburn and Alex Higgins, took place on 4 and 5 May, as a best-of-35 frames match scheduled for four sessions.[26] Thorburn had become the first player to reach a second final at the Crucible.[59] After Thorburn won the first frame, Higgins won the next five. Thorburn won the seventh to make it 5–2, with Higgins complaining after the frame that Thorburn had been standing in his line of sight, a claim that author and sports statistician Ian Morrison called "unfounded."[59] Higgins led 6–3 at the end of the first session, extending this to 9–5 before Thorburn levelled the match at 9–9.[59] Writing in The Times, Sydney Friskin described the match to this point as a contrast of styles: "the shrewd cumulative processes of Thorburn against the explosive break-building of Higgins." He also noted that each player had accused the other of distracting them during the match.[60] Thorburn won the 19th and 20th frames, with Higgins taking the following two to level at 11–11.[59] Thorburn went ahead at 12–11 and 13–12, with Higgins then levelling the match both times, with the third session ending 13-13.[26][61] In the final session, Higgins won the first frame then Thorburn won the next two, before Higgins equalised at 15–15. Thorburn led 16–15, and missed an easy brown ball that let Higgins in to make it 16–16.[59] With a break of 119, Thorburn moved within a frame of victory at 17–16. In the 34th frame, leading 45–9 in points, he laid a snooker for Higgins, and made a 51 break after that to win the title.[59] The BBC's television coverage of the final
