Just last summer, he and his wife decided to pay a visit to one of the most sacred tribes in Africa, the legendary Sombas.

They've been known for quite some time now by the elites and the scientific community for their special elongation method.

For many years, decades in fact, many people have been trying to learn the insights of this ritual, but with no luck.

Until this guy came and did the most unthinkable thing...

He gave his wife in exchange for the growth secret!

It was incredible! In fact, they filmed the whole thing and documented every step of this ritual...

BE CAREFUL.

This should be used wisely because it grows your member by 4 to 7 inches in a few weeks.

In fact, it already created some monsters out there...

Oh... and if you wonder if the African tribe fellows scored on the white chick, the answer is YES!
That's why I said you have to see this...




















When Caesar returned to Rome, the Senate granted him triumphs for his victories, ostensibly those over Gaul, Egypt, Pharnaces, and Juba, rather than over his Roman opponents.[citation needed] When Arsinoe IV, Egypt's former queen, was paraded in chains, the spectators admired her dignified bearing and were moved to pity.[119] Triumphal games were held, with beast-hunts involving 400 lions, and gladiator contests. A naval battle was held on a flooded basin at the Field of Mars.[120] At the Circus Maximus, two armies of war captives, — each of 2,000 people, 200 horses, and 20 elephants — fought to the death. Again, some bystanders complained, this time at Caesar's wasteful extravagance. A riot broke out, and stopped only when Caesar had two rioters sacrificed by the priests on the Field of Mars.[120] After the triumph, Caesar set out to pass an ambitious legislative agenda.[120] He ordered a census be taken, which forced a reduction in the grain dole, and decreed that jurors could come only from the Senate or the equestrian ranks. He passed a sumptuary law that restricted the purchase of certain luxuries. After this, he passed a law that rewarded families for having many children, to speed up the repopulation of Italy. Then, he outlawed professional guilds, except those of ancient foundation, since many of these were subversive political clubs. He then passed a term-limit law applicable to governors. He passed a debt-restructuring law, which ultimately eliminated about a fourth of all debts owed.[120] The Forum of Caesar, with its Temple of Venus Genetrix, was then built, among many other public works.[121] Caesar also tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register.[122] From 47 to 44 BC, he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans.[123] Statue of Julius Caesar, Via dei Fori Imperiali, Rome The most important change, however, was his reform of the Roman calendar. The calendar at the time was regulated by the movement of the moon. By replacing it with the Egyptian calendar, based on t
