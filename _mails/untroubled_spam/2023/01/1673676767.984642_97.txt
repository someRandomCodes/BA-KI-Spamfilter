<p><b style="font: 9.5px Nyala; color: #FF6347;">The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled.Poison ivy grew through the fence they said was impenetrable.He set out for a short walk, but now all he could see were mangroves and water were for miles.Behind the window was a reflection that only instilled fear.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.Having no hair made him look even hairier.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his life.He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.They called out her name time and again, but were met with nothing but silence.I think I will buy the red car, or I will lease the blue one.We have a lot of rain in June.There are no heroes in a punk rock band.He excelled at firing people nicely.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.He shaved the peach to prove a point.The shooter says goodbye to his love.Despite multiple complications and her near-death experienceShe wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.We should play with legos at camp.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.Pink horses galloped across the sea.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.My uncle&#39;s favorite pastime was building cars out of noodles.Lets all be unique together until we realise we are all the same.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Nyala; color: #FF6347;">He watched the dancing piglets with panda bear tummies in the swimming pool.His mind was blown that there was nothing in space except space itself.Siri became confused when we reused to follow her directions.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.You&#39;ve been eyeing me all day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.The pigs were insulted that they were named hamburgers.Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.The shooter says goodbye to his love.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.He found the end of the rainbow and was surprised at what he found there.When motorists sped in and out of traffic, all she could think of was those in need of a transplant.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.Please put on these earmuffs because I can&#39;t you hear.He realized there had been several deaths on this road, but his concern rose when he saw the exact number.The delicious aroma from the kitchen was ruined by cigarette smoke.Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.The fence was confused about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.She did a happy dance because all of the socks from the dryer matched.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Nyala; color: #FF6347;">Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.He had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will never need a shrink.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.They looked up at the sky and saw a million stars.He barked orders at his daughters but they just stared back with amusement.Just because the water is red doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t drink it.Beach-combing replaced wine tasting as his new obsession.I may struggle with geography, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m somewhere around here.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.He was sure the Devil created red sparkly glitter.I ate a sock because people on the Internet told me to.At that moment she realized she had a sixth sense.She couldn&#39;t decide of the glass was half empty or half full so she drank it.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his friend go.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains life well.She wanted to be rescued, but only if it was Tuesday and raining.Jeanne wished she has chosen the red button.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.Please wait outside of the house.He never understood why what, when, and where left out who.It was the first time he had ever seen someone cook dinner on an elephant.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one only knew how to play bongos.Pantyhose and heels are an interesting choice of attire for the beach.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.</b></p>
