<p><b style="font: 8.5px Andale Mono; color: #306EFF;">He shaved the peach to prove a point.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.I&#39;ve seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine.It took him a month to finish the meal.He shaved the peach to prove a point.He excelled at firing people nicely.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.They&#39;re playing the piano while flying in the plane.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.waiting for exceptional things to just happen.He wasn&#39;t bitter that she had moved on but from the radish.One small would change her , but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.We need to rent a room for our party.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.She was by the large chunks of ice washing up on the beach.Joe discovered that cones make excellent megaphones.Every manager should be able to recite at least ten nursery rhymes backward.There are few things better in than a slice of pie.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.Nancy thought the way to create a welcoming was to line it with barbed wire.Martha came to the conclusion that shake weights are agreat gift for any occasion.Mothers spend months of their lives waiting on their children.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.Red is greener than purple, for sure.</b></p>
