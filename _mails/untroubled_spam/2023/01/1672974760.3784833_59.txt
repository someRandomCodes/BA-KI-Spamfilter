			<p style="text-align: center;">The telescope was invented by Johns Hopkins University and released on July 1.<br />


			<br />


			The purpose of this study is to achieve maximum magnification at the smallest effective aperture while ensuring the luminous flux and resolution angle of the telescope.<br />


			<br />


			<strong>This telescope is the first attempt to use nano-etching technology</strong>, nano-array technology, mesoporous assembly technology, thin-film mosaic technology, and nano-optical materials to make the flatness error of the lens reach 10nm.<br />


			<br />


			<strong>The luminous flux reaches 30 times that of ordinary telescopes with the same diameter</strong>. <strong>The resolution angle is 47 times</strong> that of ordinary telescopes with the same diameter.<br />

<p><b style="font: 7px Rockwell Nova Cond; color: #dd2727;">It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is a matter of time.The two walked down the slot canyon oblivious to the sound of thunder in the distance.Whenever he saw a red flag warning at the beach he grabbed his surfboard.He watched the dancing piglets with panda bear tummies in the swimming pool.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Even with the snow falling outside, she felt it appropriate to wear her bikini.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.I used to practice weaving with spaghetti three hours a day but stopped because I didn&#39;t want to die alone.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should Nair.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.His rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.I&#39;ve seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine.I don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.They say people remember important moments in their well, yet no one even remembers their own birth.They called out her time and again, but were met with nothing but silence.The sky is clear; the stars are twinkling.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.The random sentence generator generated a random sentence about a random sentence.We will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along.The Japanese yen for commerce is still well-known.The hummingbird&#39;s wings blurred while it eagerly sipped the sugar water from the feeder.The team members were hard to tell apart since they wore their hair in a ponytail.She was too short to see over the fence.</b></p>
