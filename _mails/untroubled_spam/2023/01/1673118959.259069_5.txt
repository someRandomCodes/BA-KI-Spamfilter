Louis IX never abandoned the idea of the liberation of Jerusalem, but he decided to begin his new crusade with a military campaign against Tunis.[117][118] According to his confessor, Geoffrey of Beaulieu, Louis was convinced that al-Mustansir of Tunis was ready to convert to Christianity.[117] The 13th-century historian Saba Malaspina stated that Charles persuaded Louis to attack Tunis, because he wanted to secure the payment of the tribute that the rulers of Tunis had paid to the former Sicilian monarchs.[119] The French crusaders embarked at Aigues-Mortes on 2 July 1270; Charles departed from Naples six days later.[120] He spent more than a month in Sicily, waiting for his fleet.[120] By the time he landed at Tunis on 25 August,[120] dysentery and typhoid fever had decimated the French army.[118] Louis died the day Charles arrived.[118] The crusaders twice defeated Al-Mustansir's army, forcing him to sue for peace.[121] According to the peace treaty, signed on 1 November, Al-Mustansir agreed to fully compensate Louis' son and successor, Philip III of France, and Charles for the expenses of the military campaign and to release his Christian prisoners.[121] He also promised to pay a yearly tribute to Charles and to expel Charles's opponents from Tunis.[122] The gold from Tunis, along with silver from the newly opened mine at Longobucco, enabled Charles to mint new coins, known as carlini, in the Regno.[123] Charles and Philip departed Tunis on 10 November.[118] A storm dispersed their fleet at Trapani and most of Charles's galleys were lost or damaged.[121] Genoese ships returning from the crusade were also sunk or forced to land in Sicily.[124] Charles seized the damaged ships and their cargo, ignoring all protests from t
