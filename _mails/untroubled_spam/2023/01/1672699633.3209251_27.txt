<p><b style="font: 10px BIZ UDGothic; color: #357EC7;">He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.Improve your goldfish&#39;s physical fitness by getting him a bicycle.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.As you consider all the possible ways to improve yourself and the world, you notice John Travolta seems fairly unhappy.It&#39;s not often you find a soggy banana on the street.He went on a whiskey diet and immediately lost three days.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.Never underestimate the willingness of the greedy to throw you under the bus.She let the balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.He dreamed of eating green apples with worms.The urgent care center was flooded with patients after the news of a new deadly virus was made public.The father died during childbirth.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.I checked to make sure that he was still alive.A glittering gem is not enough.I checked to make sure that he was still alive.She wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px BIZ UDGothic; color: #357EC7;">Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.Improve your goldfish&#39;s physical fitness by getting him a bicycle.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.It was a really good Monday for being a Saturday.The body piercing didn&#39;t go exactly as he expected.He had a wall full of masks so she could wear a different face every day.The secret code they created made no sense, even to them.Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of all minerals.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.I cheated while playing the darts tournament by using a longbow.The toy brought back fond memories of being lost in the rain forest.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.Greetings from the real universe.The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.All you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.He had decided to accept his fate of accepting his fate.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains life well.The father died during childbirth.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.He had a hidden stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px BIZ UDGothic; color: #357EC7;">She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.25 years later, she still regretted that specific moment.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.When he encountered maize for the first time, he thought it incredibly corny.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.Of course, she loves her pink bunny slippers.One small action would change her life, but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this all about?You should never take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.After fighting off the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.Sometimes you have to just give up and win by cheating.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in order to be with her.Watching the geriatric men&rsquo;s softball team brought back memories of 3 yr olds playing t-ball.Hit me with your pet shark!The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.He wasn&#39;t bitter that she had moved on but from the radish.She was too short to see over the fence.Too many prisons have become early coffins.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain all of her strangeness.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.The thunderous roar of the jet overhead confirmed her worst fears.</b></p>
