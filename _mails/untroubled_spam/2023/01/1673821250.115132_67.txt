<p><b style="font: 7px Lucida Handwriting; color: #488AC7;">They were excited to see their first sloth.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.The mysterious diary records the voice.They looked up at the sky and saw a millin stars.I like to work after my eight-hour tea-break.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in oder to be with her.He ran out of , so he had to playing poker.The external scars tell part of the story.It was the first time he had ever seen someone cook dinner on an elephant.A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can&#39;t read.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.When confronted with a rotary dial the teenager was perplexed.I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.put on these earmuffs because I can&#39;t you hear.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.Having no hair made him look even hairier.It was the sandcastle he had ever seen.A glittering gem is not enough.Harrold felt confident that nobody would ever suspect his spy pigeon.Lets be unique together until we realize we are the same.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.I honestly find her about as intimidating as a basket of kittens.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to cigarettes.I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated.When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand and I still remember it quite vividly.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7px Lucida Handwriting; color: #488AC7;">Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.He was the of the club who didn&#39;t like plum pudding.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.I met an interesting turtle while the song on the radio blasted away.Nancy thought the way to create a welcoming was to line it with barbed wire.I ate a sock because people on the Internet told me to.Nothing seemed out of place except the washing machine in the bar.The bees decided to have a mutiny against their queen.I currently have 4 windows up&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t know why.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.There&#39;s probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium.The pigs were insulted that they were named hamburgers.She opened up her third bottle of wine of the night.The external scars tell part of the story.Peter found road kill an excellent way to on dinner.Shakespeare was a famous 17th-century diesel mechanic.they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.He said he was not there yesterday; however, many people saw him there.He wondered if it could be called a beach if there was no sand.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled.Tody arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.Situps are a terrible way to end your day.You&#39;re good at English when you know the difference between a man eating chicken and a man-eating chicken.Every manager should be able to recite at least ten nursery rhymes backward.As she walked along the street and looked in the gutter, she realized facemasks had become the cigarette butts.They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy.The door swung to reveal pink giraffes and red elephants.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7px Lucida Handwriting; color: #488AC7;">He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.She was the type of girl that always burnt sugar to show she cared.A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.Acres of almond trees lined the interstate highway which complimented the crazy driving nuts.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.After fighting the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.He was sure the Devil created red sparkly glitter.For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.They were excited to see their first sloth.I&#39;ve seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine.Todaywe gathered moss for my uncle&#39;s wedding.At lastHe had decided to accept his fate of accepting his fate.The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.You&#39;re good at English when you know the difference between a man eating chicken and a man-eating chicken.A good example of a useful vegetable is medicinal rhubarb.When he had to picnic on the beach, he purposely put sand in other people&rsquo;s food.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is a matter of time.She tilted her head back and let whip cream stream into her mouth while taking a bath.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.It took him a month to finish the meal.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this about?He didn&rsquo;t want to go to the dentist, yet he went anyway.The tree fell unexpectedly short.</b></p>
