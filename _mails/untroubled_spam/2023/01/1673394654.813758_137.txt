<p><b style="font: 9px Vani; color: #800080;">It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.His mind was blown that there was nothing in space except space itself.At lastThe memory we used to share is no longer coherent.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.Bill ran from the giraffe toward the dolphin.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.He was the only member of the club who didn&#39;t like plum pudding.On each full moonHe colored deep space a soft yellow.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good environment for learning English.He felt that dining on the bridge brought romance to his relationship with his cat.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.You have no right to call yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a great lockpick.The near-death experience brought new ideas to light.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.Harrold felt confident that nobody would ever suspect his spy pigeon.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.He found his art never progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.She finally understood that grief was her love with no place for it to go.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.Tuesdays are free if you bring a gnome costume.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Vani; color: #800080;">Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.Lucifer was surprised at the amount of life at Death Valley.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.I don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.Mothers spend months of their lives waiting on their children.I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of gold, Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.He would only survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.Harrold felt confident that nobody would ever suspect his spy pigeon.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.I am never at home on Sundays.Abstraction is often one floor above you.At that moment she realized she had a sixth sense.She was only made the society president because she can whistle with her toes.She wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his friend go.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.his seven-layer cake only had six layers.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best friend, but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.One small action would change her life, but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.We need to rent a room for our party.He never understood why what, when, and where left out who.If you like tuna and tomato sauce, try combining the two, it&rsquo;s really not as bad as it sounds.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain all of her strangeness.Pantyhose and heels are an interesting choice of attire for the beach.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.He liked to play with words in the bathtub.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.I had a friend in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Vani; color: #800080;">I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.The group quickly understood that toxic waste was the most effective barrier to use against the zombies.She was too busy always talking about what she wanted to do to actually do any of it.Had he known what was going to happen, he would have never stepped into the shower.The miniature pet elephant became the envy of the neighborhood.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.She cried diamonds.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.She saw the brake lights, but not in time.Swim at your own risk was taken as a challenge for the group of Kansas City college students.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.Erin accidentally created a new universe.When confronted with a rotary dial phone the teenager was perplexed.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.She was amazed by the large chunks of ice washing up on the beach.He told us a very exciting adventure story.He had decided to accept his fate of accepting his fate.Choosing to do nothing is still a choice, after all.The gloves protect my feet from excess work.Excitement replaced fear until the final moment.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.He was surprised that his immense laziness was inspirational to others.Three generations with six decades of life experience.She cried diamonds.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Vani; color: #800080;">I&rsquo;m a living furnace.We should play with legos at camp.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.He would only survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.Buried deep in the snow, he hoped his batteries were fresh in his avalanche beacon.She traveled because it cost the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.There is no better feeling than staring at a wall with closed eyes.He played the game as if his life depended on it and the truth was that it did.Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.[TEXTSPIN:Potato wedges probably are not best for relationships.|Each person who knows you
