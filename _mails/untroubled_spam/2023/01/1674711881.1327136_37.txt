<p><b style="font: 7px SimHei; color: #726E6D;">It didn&#39;t take long for Gary to detect the robbers were amateurs.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.It&#39;s been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his .There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.There&#39;s no reason a hula hoop can&#39;t also be a circus ring.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.We have a lot of rain in June.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide the way to the deepest depths.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.She had convinced her kids that any mushroom found on the ground would kill them if they touched it.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.After coating myself in vegetable oil I found my sucess rte skyrocketed.The fog was so dense even a laser decided it wasn&#39;t worth the effort.Having no hair made him look even hairier.He wondered if it could be called a beach if there was no sand.Just go ahead and press that button.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.The elderly neighborhood became enraged over the coyotes who had been blamed for the poodle&rsquo;s disappearance.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July.She can live her however she wants as long as she listens to what I have to say.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.You&#39;re unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.</b></p>
