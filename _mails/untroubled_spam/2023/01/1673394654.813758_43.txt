English composers of the late 15th century and early 16th century set a limited number of types of sacred music, each with a clear place in the liturgy.[24] Until the Reformation of 1534, when Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church, English composers based their works on the Sarum rite, abolished in 1547.[25] During the decades following the Reformation, the lives of English church musicians changed according to the policies of the reigning monarch. Henry allowed church music in England to continue to be written in a florid style, and use Latin texts, but during the reign of his son and successor, Edward VI, highly polyphonic music was no longer permitted, and the authorities destroyed church organs and music, and abolished choral foundations. These changes were never completely restored by Edward's successor Mary during her brief reign; their half-sister Elizabeth, who succeeded Mary in 1558, confirmed or reinstated some of Edward's work.[26] Parsley's compositional career spanned the reigns of all four monarchs. He wrote church music for both the Latin and English rites.[23] His Anglican church music for the Daily Office included a morning service, involving the Benedictus canticle and the Te Deum, and an evening service that involved the singing of two canticles, the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis.[27] The musicologist Howard Brown noted that Parsley belonged to a group of outstanding composers from the middle period of the 16th centuryâ€”William Mundy, Robert Parsons, John Sheppard, Christopher Tye, Th
