<p><b style="font: 8.5px DengXian; color: #006400;">If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.The fence was confused about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.The father died during childbirth.The delicious aroma from the kitchen was ruined by cigarette smoke.they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.You can&#39;t apples and oranges, but what about bananas and plantains?Not people who wander are lost.It&#39;s always a good idea to seek shelter from the evil gaze of the sun.Don&#39;t put peanut butter on the dog&#39;s nose.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.She wasn&#39;t sure whether to be impressed or concerned that he folded underwear in neat little packages.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.waiting for exceptional things to just happen.That must be the tenth time I&#39;ve been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.You&#39;ve been eyeing me day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.He figured a few sticks of dynamite were easier than a fishing pole to catch fish.The wooden spoon couldn&rsquo;t cut but left emotional scars.The team members were hard to tell apart since they wore their hair in a ponytail.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8.5px DengXian; color: #006400;">Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.The dead trees waited to be ignited by the smallest spark and seek their revenge.Let me help you with your baggage.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.He played the game as if his depended on it and the truth was that it did.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.Nancy decided to make the porta-potty her .Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.Let me help you with your baggage.He figured a few sticks of dynamite were easier than a fishing pole to catch fish.It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but she could make herself happy.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.Gary didn&#39;t understand why Doug went upstairs to one dollar bills when he invited him to go cow tipping.So long and thanks for the fish.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.On each full moonBehind the window was a reflection that instilled fear.She had convinced her kids that any mushroom found on the ground would kill them if they touched it.People generally approve of dogs eating cat food but not cats eating dog food.I am nevr at hom on Sundays.He had a vague sense that trees gave birth to dinosaurs.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.</b></p>
