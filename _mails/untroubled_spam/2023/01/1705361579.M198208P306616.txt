Hi Bruce=2C

You have another chance to get farmers some much-needed carbon tax relief.

Bill C-234 is a bill that would remove the carbon tax from natural gas and=
 propane used on farms. Farmers use these fuels to dry grain and heat barn=
s.

Recently=2C the bill passed through the Senate with amendments that gut th=
e bill and reduce the relief.

But now the House of Commons gets a shot at the bill again. So=2C now the=
 fight is on to reject these amendments and pass the original bill to get=
 farmers full relief.

To win this fight we are building up an army of supporters that can step u=
p to the plate to fight for farmers at a moment=E2=80=99s notice.

You can join that army by signing the online PETITION: https://taxpayer.us=
1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3De436226d501953d6bf1068db8&id=3D0f1f14ec3=

e&status2=3D
)

You know that farmers work long hours so the rest of us can look forward t=
o three square meals a day. It=E2=80=99s time to repay that hard work.

Members of Parliament head back to Ottawa soon=2C and last time this bill=
 was in the House=2C it was unanimously supported by the Conservatives=2C=
 NDP=2C Bloc and Greens. Even three Liberals voted for it.

That needs to happen again.

Please sign the PETITION to get farmers carbon tax relief: https://taxpaye=
r.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3De436226d501953d6bf1068db8&id=3D50646=

*true&status2=3D
)

You know we need to completely scrap the carbon tax. But passing Bill C-23=
4 puts another chink in the carbon tax=E2=80=99s armour.

I=E2=80=99ll be updating you every time we have a chance to notch up the p=
ressure on these politicians. My family back home on the farm won=E2=80=99=
t let me forget about this fight.

Sincerely=2C

Gage Haubrich
Prairie Director for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation

PS: It only takes a minute to sign the PETITION and step up and fight for=
 farmers: https://taxpayer.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3De436226d501=
