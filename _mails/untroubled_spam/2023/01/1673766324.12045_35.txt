<p><b style="font: 4px Latha; color: #659EC7;">You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.We will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.Jenny made the announcement that her baby was an alien.I cheated while playing the darts tournament by using a longbow.Bill ran from the giraffe toward the dolphin.Nancy thought the way to create a welcoming was to line it with barbed wire.He walked into the basement with the horror movie from the night before playing in his head.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.wait outside of the house.She says she has the ability to hear the soundtrack of yourlife.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.She tilted her head back and let whip cream stream into her mouth while taking a bath.The virus had powers none of us knew existed.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should Nair.I checked to make sure that he was still alive.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy.The worst thing about being at the top of the career ladder is that there&#39;s a long way to fall.He spiked his hair green to support his iguana.It was the sandcastle he had ever seen.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.The shooter says goodbye to his love.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.</b></p>
