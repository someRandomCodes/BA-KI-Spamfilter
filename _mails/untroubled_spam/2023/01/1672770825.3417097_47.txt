<p><b style="font: 8.5px Kartika; color: #357EC7;">Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.He learned the important lesson that a picnic at the beach on a windy day is a bad idea.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.This is a Japanese doll.The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable.Love is not like pizza.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.Hit me with your pet shark!The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.He went on a whiskey diet and immediately lost three days.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.I would have gotten the promotion, but my attendance wasn&rsquo;t good enough.I&#39;ve never seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine.Never underestimate the willingness of the greedy to throw you under the bus.Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.Best friends are like old tomatoes and shoelaces.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.There&#39;s probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.He ran out of money, so he had to stop playing poker.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to buy cigarettes.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.Traveling became almost extinct during the pandemic.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8.5px Kartika; color: #357EC7;">Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.I like to leave work after my eight-hour tea-break.Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to get milk.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.Lucifer was surprised at the amount of life at Death Valley.Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition.I used to live in my neighbor&#39;s fishpond, but the aesthetic wasn&#39;t to my taste.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn&#39;t quite go as expected.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing open my piggy bank on the same day!I hear that Nancy is very pretty.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.He is no James Bond; his name is Roger Moore.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.Having no hair made him look even hairier.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.The fox in the tophat whispered into the ear of the rabbit.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best friend, but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.Peanut butter and jelly caused the elderly lady to think about her past.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8.5px Kartika; color: #357EC7;">As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.When he encountered maize for the first time, he thought it incredibly corny.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is only a matter of time.She is never happy until she finds something to be unhappy about; then, she is overjoyed.It&#39;s never been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.The door slammed on the watermelon.He kept telling himself that one day it would all somehow make sense.Kevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.He had reached the point where he was paranoid about being paranoid.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing open my piggy bank on the same day!That was how he came to win $1 million.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.The white water rafting trip was suddenly halted by the unexpected brick wall.Hit me with your pet shark!Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.As he dangled from the rope deep inside the crevasseHappiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.Giving directions that the mountains are to the west only works when you can see them.Getting up at dawn is for the birds.Too many prisons have become early coffins.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.</b></p>
