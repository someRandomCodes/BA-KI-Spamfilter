The first attempts at setting up a national general union were made in the 1820s and 30s. The National Association for the Protection of Labour was established in 1830 by John Doherty, after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the National Union of Cotton-spinners. The Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions, consisting mostly of textile related unions, but also including mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others. Membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire within a year. To establish awareness and legitimacy, the union started the weekly Voice of the People publication, having the declared intention "to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union."

In 1834, the Welsh socialist Robert Owen established the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union. The organization attracted a range of socialists from Owenites to revolutionaries and played a part in the protests after the Tolpuddle Martyrs' case, but soon collapsed.

More permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The London Trades Council was founded in 1860, and the Sheffield Outrages spurred the establishment of the Trades Union Congress in 1868, the first long-lived national trade union center. By this time, the existence and the demands of the trade unions were becoming accepted by liberal middle-class opinion. In Principles of Political Economy (1871) John Stuart Mill wrote:

If it were possible for the working classes, by combining among them

<strong>Hey,</strong><br />
<br />
One of these healthy foods can cause stool to get trapped inside your bowel&hellip;<br />
<br />
<mark style="font-weight:bold;">Not just for a day or a week&hellip;</mark><br />
<br />
But for YEARS!<br />
<br />
Can you make a guess which food is secretly terrible for you?<br />
<br />

b. Spinach<br />
c. Tomatoes<br />
d. Avocado</a><br />
<br />
You see&hellip;<br />
<br />
When food gets trapped inside the colon for too long&hellip;<br />
<br />
It turns your colon into a breeding ground for harmful intestinal parasites.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The science is clear.</b></u><br />
<br />
In fact, a recent medical study reviewed the autopsies of people who died at the age of 30 and 40&hellip;<br />
<br />
Guess what they found?<br />
<br />
Their colon was 80% full of clogged toxic food waste.<br />
<br />
<b>So, imagine how clogged your colon must be now if you&#39;re in your 50&#39;s or 70&#39;s?</b><br />
<br />
The truth is&hellip;<br />
<br />
Even if you&#39;re eating <strong>&ldquo;healthy&rdquo;&hellip;</strong><br />

That&rsquo;s why, I&#39;ve been taking this <strong>&quot;unusual remedy&quot;</strong> to keep my gut free from toxic food.<br />
