<p><b style="font: 7.5px LilyUPC; color: #736AFF;">She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.She finally understood that grief was her love with no place for it to go.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.The sun had set and so had his dreams.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.The dead trees waited to be ignited by the smallest spark and seek their revenge.He liked to play with words in the bathtub.One small would change her , but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.Of course, she loves her pink bunny slippers.Situps are a terrible way to end your day.The stranger officiates the meal.When motorists sped in and out of , she could think of was those in need of a transplant.My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.He played the game as if his depended on it and the truth was that it did.I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.is the day I&#39;ll finally know what brick tastes like.A glittering gem is not enough.Red is greener than purple, for sure.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.He loved eating his bananas in hot dog buns.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.He uses onomatopoeia as a weapon of mental destruction.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe.He was business when he wore his clown suit.Buried deep in the snow, he hoped his batteries were fresh in his avalanche beacon.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7.5px LilyUPC; color: #736AFF;">He watched the dancing piglets with panda bear tummies in the swimming pool.As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July.Love is not like pizza.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.Nancy was proud that she ran a tight shipwreck.David proudly graduated from high school top of his class at age 97.Her in the confines of the house became her normal.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.It didn&#39;t make sense unless you had the power to eat colors.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.He took one look at what was under the table and noped the hell out of there.He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes the same things that I do.Just go ahead and press that button.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.I liked their first two albums but changed my mind after that charity gig.She wanted to be rescued, but if it was Tuesday and raining.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.She tilted her head back and let whip cream stream into her mouth while taking a bath.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.As time wore on, simple dog commands turned into full paragraphs explaining why the dog couldn&rsquo;t do something.The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7.5px LilyUPC; color: #736AFF;">Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.He realized there had been several deaths on this road, but his concern rose when he saw the exact number.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.The lake is a long way from .She looked into the mirror and saw another person.He drank before spitting it out.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.My uncle&#39;s favorite pastime was building cars out of noodles.There are few things better in than a slice of pie.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.Nobody loves a pig wearing lipstick.I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.The view from the lighthouse excited even the most seasoned traveler.Flying fish flew by the space station.is the day I&#39;ll finally know what brick tastes like.She saw no irony asking me to change but wanting me to accept her for who she is.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.The Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.The door swung to reveal pink giraffes and red elephants.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.No matter how beautiful the sunset, it saddened her knowing she was one day older.She could hear him in the shower singing with a joy she hoped he&#39;d retain after she delivered the news.We should play with legos at camp.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.</b></p>
