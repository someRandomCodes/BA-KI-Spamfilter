Hey,
http://www.walmartsurvys.us/10907-174-5131-33995/bruce/tindex10.html
One of these healthy foods can cause stool to get trapped inside your bowel…

Not just for a day or a week…

But for YEARS!
http://www.walmartsurvys.us/10907-174-5131-33995/bruce/tindex11.html
Can you make a guess which food is secretly terrible for you?

a. Wholemeal bread
b. Spinach
c. Tomatoes
d. Avocado

You see…

When food gets trapped inside the colon for too long…

It turns your colon into a breeding ground for harmful intestinal parasites.

The science is clear.

In fact, a recent medical study reviewed the autopsies of people who died at the age of 30 and 40…

Guess what they found?

Their colon was 80% full of clogged toxic food waste.

So, imagine how clogged your colon must be now if you're in your 50's or 70's?

The truth is…

Even if you're eating “healthy”…

Your colon could be in danger because of THIS.

That’s why, I've been taking this "unusual remedy" to keep my gut free from toxic food.

It's NOT laxatives, probiotics, or fiber supplements.

It's way better:



=> "Unusual Remedy" Removes Toxic Food Waste From Your Colon

Sincerely,
William

Open warfare erupted when British regulars sent to capture a cache of military supplies were confronted by local Patriot militia at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Patriot militia, joined by the newly formed Continental Army, then put British forces in Boston under siege by land and they withdrew by sea. Each colony formed a Provincial Congress, which assumed power from the former colonial governments, suppressed Loyalism, and contributed to the Continental Army led by Commander in Chief General George Washington. The Patriots unsuccessfully attempted to invade Quebec and rally sympathetic colonists there during the winter of 1775–76. The Continental Congress declared British King George III a tyrant who trampled the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they pronounced the colonies free and independent states on July 4, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject rule by monarchy and aristocracy. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed that all men are created equal, though it was not until later centuries that constitutional amendments and federal laws would incrementally grant equal rights to African Americans, Native Americans, poor white men, and women. The British captured New York City and its strategic harbor in the summer of 1776. The Continental Army captured a British army at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, and France then entered the war as an ally of the United States, expanding the war into a global conflict. The British Royal Navy blockaded ports and held New York City for the duration of the war, and other cities for brief periods, but they failed to destroy Washington's forces. Britain's priorities shifted southward, attempting to hold the Southern states with the anticipated aid of Loyalists that never materialized. British general Charles Cornwallis captured an American army at Charleston, South Carolina in early 1780, but he failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. Finally, a combined American and French force captured Cornwallis' army at Yorktown in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war. The Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, formally
