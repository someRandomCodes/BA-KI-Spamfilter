<p><b style="font: 5px Kokila; color: #ff0000;">He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.Random words in front of other random words create a random sentence.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to milk.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to the sewage flowing from his mouth.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.He wondered if it could be called a beach if there was no sand.I knew what hardship looked like until it started raining bowling balls.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.The ice-cream trucks bring back bad memories for of us.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.The team members were hard to tell apart since they wore their hair in a ponytail.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.Gwen had her best sleep ever on her bed of nails.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.Shakespeare was a famous 17th-century diesel mechanic.She can live her however she wants as long as she listens to what I have to say.8 of 25 is the same as 25 of 8 and one of them is much easier to do in your head.It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.It&#39;s much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.Two more days and his problems would be solved.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.The father died during childbirth.</b></p>
