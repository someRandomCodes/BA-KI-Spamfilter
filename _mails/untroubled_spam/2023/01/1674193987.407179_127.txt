<p><b style="font: 10px Monaco; color: #800080;">At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this about?Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can&#39;t read.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.Barking dogs and screaming toddlers have the unique ability to turn friendly neighbors into cranky enemies.I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realIt was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the lady&rsquo;s bag of food.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.The llama couldn&#39;t resist trying the lemonade.She says she has the ability to hear the soundtrack of yourlife.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.He liked to play with words in the bathtub.With the high wind warningGreetings from the real universe.When he encountered maize for the first time, he thought it incredibly corny.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.I enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.Trash covered the landscape like sprinkles do a birthday cake.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.I ate a sock because people on the Internet told me to.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.There is no better feeling than staring at a wall with closed eyes.Cursive writing is thebest way to build a race track.They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy.Nancy was proud that she ran a tight shipwreck.The elephant didn&#39;t want to talk about the person in the room.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px Monaco; color: #800080;">You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.It&#39;s a skateboarding penguin with a sunhat!Karen believed al trafic laws should be obeyed by ll except herself.She paints with bold colors; she does not like pastels.We will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.He felt that dining on the bridge brought romance to his relationship with his cat.25 years later, she still regretted that specific moment.I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve written over fifty novelsHer fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.The gloves protect my feet from excess work.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.As time wore on, simple dog commands turned into full paragraphs explaining why the dog couldn&rsquo;t do something.It took him a month to finish the meal.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.The key lime pie is still up for debate.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.After fighting the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.Nancy decided to make the porta-potty her .I don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.Siri became confused when we reused to follow her directions.He spiked his hair green to support his iguana.I hear that Nancy is very pretty.You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px Monaco; color: #800080;">To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn&#39;t quite go as expected.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.He barked orders at his daughters but they just stared back with amusement.One small would change her , but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be determined.He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.Two seats were vacant.Everybody should read Chaucer to improve their everyday vocabulary.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.People generally approve of dogs eating cat food but not cats eating dog food.I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.He didn&rsquo;t want to go to the dentist, yet he went anyway.Greetings from the galaxy MACS0647-JD, or what we .Whenever he saw a red flag warning at the beach he grabbed his surfboard.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.The wake behind the boat told of the past while the sea for told in the unknown future.He learned the important lesson that a picnic at the beach on a windy day is a bad idea.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.Jason lived his ife by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.Swim at your own risk was taken as a challenge for the group of Kansas City college students.The fence was confused about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out.The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable.He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.He invested some skill points in Charisma and Strength.Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.</b></p>
