<p><b style="font: 10px David; color: #FF6347;">He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.Poison ivy grew through the fence they said was impenetrable.He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the class.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his life.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.The blinking lights of the antenna tower came into focus just as I heard a loud snap.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.You have every right to be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to be mean.There are no heroes in a punk rock band.Pat ordered a ghost pepper pie.If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.Trash covered the landscape like sprinkles do a birthday cake.The best part of marriage is animal crackers with peanut butter.More RVs were seen in the storage lot than at the campground.I met an interesting turtle while the song on the radio blasted away.You should never take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.The heatIt must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.He walked into the basement with the horror movie from the night before playing in his head.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.Three generations with six decades of life experience.Everyone was curious about the large white blimp that appeared overnight.Jason lived his life by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px David; color: #FF6347;">He was all business when he wore his clown suit.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.At lastThe door slammed on the watermelon.My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.Joyce enjoyed eating pancakes with ketchup.Please wait outside of the house.Today is the day I&#39;ll finally know what brick tastes like.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.The pigs were insulted that they were named hamburgers.He ran out of money, so he had to stop playing poker.As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone whispering into a cell phone.They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.The secret ingredient to his wonderful life was crime.Fluffy pink unicorns are a popular status symbol among macho men.It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.He ran out of money, so he had to stop playing poker.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.The elderly neighborhood became enraged over the coyotes who had been blamed for the poodle&rsquo;s disappearance.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px David; color: #FF6347;">Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.He had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will never need a shrink.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.Not all people who wander are lost.He barked orders at his daughters but they just stared back with amusement.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of gold, Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.Erin accidentally created a new universe.Now I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realHe was sure the Devil created red sparkly glitter.I ate a sock because people on the Internet told me to.There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have money to go to the store.Sometimes you have to just give up and win by cheating.He always wore his sunglasses at night.Green should have smelled more tranquil, but somehow it just tasted rotten.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains life well.The tour bus was packed with teenage girls heading toward their next adventure.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.His get rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.He never understood why what, when, and where left out who.It was the first time he had ever seen someone cook dinner on an elephant.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain all of her strangeness.Pantyhose and heels are an interesting choice of attire for the beach.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.She traveled because it cost the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.She could hear him in the shower singing with a joy she hoped he&#39;d retain after she delivered the news.</b></p>
