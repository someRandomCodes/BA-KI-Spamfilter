<p><b style="font: 9.5px Malgun Gothic; color: #726E6D;">I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.He was surprised that his immense laziness was inspirational to others.They got there early, and they got really good seats.</b></p><br />

<p><b style="font: 9.5px Malgun Gothic; color: #726E6D;">The balloons floated away along with my hopes and dreams.His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.He put heat on the wound to see what would grow.She had the gift of being able to paint songs.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his .Excitement replaced fear until the final moment.It&#39;s a skateboarding penguin with a sunhat!The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.She says she has the ability to hear the soundtrack of yourlife.I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but - I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.Patricia loves the sound of nails strongly pressed against the chalkboard.He learned the important lesson that a picnic at the beach on a windy day is a bad idea.Tomorrow will bring something , so as a memory.It&#39;s been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.The water flowing down the river didn&rsquo;t look that powerful from the carHe spiked his hair green to support his iguana.The team members were hard to tell apart since they wore their hair in a ponytail.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.We need to rent a room for our party.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Malgun Gothic; color: #726E6D;">As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.The manager of the fruit stand always sat and sold vegetables.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.He had a stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.We will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along.The Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.We have a lot of rain in June.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.It was difficult for Mary to admit that most of her workout consisted of exercising poor judgment.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.I am my aunt&#39;s sister&#39;s daughter.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.She tilted her head back and let whip cream stream into her mouth while taking a bath.she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.You should nver take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.Barking dogs and screaming toddlers have the unique ability to turn friendly neighbors into cranky enemies.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.Three generations with six decades of experience.When confronted with a rotary dial the teenager was perplexed.As he dangled from the rope deep inside the crevassePoison ivy grew through the fence they said was impenetrable.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Malgun Gothic; color: #726E6D;">As the rental car rolled to a on the dark road, her fear increased by the moment.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.Nobody has encountered an explosive daisy and lived to tell the tale.The old apple revels in its authority.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.Pat ordered a ghost pepper pie.There are no heroes in a punk rock band.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.He decided water-skiing on a frozen lake wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.She had the gift of being able to paint songs.The Japanese yen for commerce is still well-known.He had a stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.Excitement replaced fear until the final moment.To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn&#39;t quite go as expected.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.The llama couldn&#39;t resist trying the lemonade.He&#39;s in a boy band which doesn&#39;t make much sense for a snake.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.The group quickly understood that toxic waste was the most effective barrier to use against the zombies.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.I cheated while playing the darts tournament by using a longbow.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.He&#39;s in a boy band which doesn&#39;t make much sense for a snake.There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.He shaved the peach to prove a point.</b></p>
