			<p style="text-align: center;">The telescope was invented by Johns Hopkins University and released on July 1.<br />


			<br />


			The purpose of this study is to achieve maximum magnification at the smallest effective aperture while ensuring the luminous flux and resolution angle of the telescope.<br />


			<br />


			<strong>This telescope is the first attempt to use nano-etching technology</strong>, nano-array technology, mesoporous assembly technology, thin-film mosaic technology, and nano-optical materials to make the flatness error of the lens reach 10nm.<br />


			<br />


			<strong>The luminous flux reaches 30 times that of ordinary telescopes with the same diameter</strong>. <strong>The resolution angle is 47 times</strong> that of ordinary telescopes with the same diameter.<br />
