A total of 25,013 Albany half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during October 1936, including 13 pieces set aside to be available for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual Assay Commission.[31] They were sold by the Albany Dongan Charter Coin Committee for $2 each.[32] The price was considered high for the time (a more usual price for a new issue then would be $1 or $1.50). Additionally, the commemorative coin mania that had been sweeping the country in the spring and summer of 1936 had already seen close to twenty other commemorative coins issued that same year, and had abated by the time the Albany piece was available.[17] Sales were thus unexpectedly low. The Albany Dongan Committee continued to sell the coins until 1943, refusing to lower the public price,[4] though the entire remaining stock was offered to New York City coin dealer Abe Kosoff at face value plus $50. He declined,[28] unwilling to buy them all himself and unable to find backers for a syndicate to purchase them.[17] The committee wrote to O'Reilly in February 1937, wanting to know the procedure for returning unsold coins,[33] and in 1943, with sales at a standstill, it returned 7,342 pieces for redemption and melting, leaving 17,658 specimens extant.[23] The retail price from coin dealers of the Albany half dollar in uncirculated condition dropped as low as $1.50 in 1940, recovering to $4 in 1950.[34] In 1954 it became known that the State Bank of Albany had some 2,000 Albany half dollars in its vaults and was willing to sell them for the original issue price of $2. They sold to several local collectors and dealers.[28] At the time, the market price was $8.[26] By 1970, the market price was $80 and by 1985, $400.[34] As of 2009, the coin could fetch $330 for an uncirculated coin rated as MS-60, and $470 for an MS-65.[35] The deluxe edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guid
