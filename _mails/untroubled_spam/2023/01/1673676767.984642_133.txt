Although, a supermajority is required in circumstances where a specific state is affected by a referendum, a majority of voters in that state must also agree to the change. This is often referred to as a "triple majority". As such, the Australian Constitution is often regarded as the hardest in the world to change.[citation needed] Canada In Canada, most constitutional amendments can be passed only if identical resolutions are adopted by the House of Commons, the Senate and two-thirds or more of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50 percent of the national population.
