While the holotype of Peloneustes lacks the rear portion of its cranium, many additional well-preserved specimens, including one that has not been crushed from top to bottom, have been assigned to this genus. These crania vary in size, measuring 60–78.5 centimetres (1.97–2.58 ft) in length. The cranium of Peloneustes is elongated and slopes upwards towards its back end.[2] Viewed from above, the cranium is shaped like an isosceles triangle,[10]: 35  with the back of the cranium broad and the front elongated into a narrow rostrum. The rearmost part of the cranium has roughly parallel sides, unlike the tapering front regions. The external nares (openings for the nostrils) are small and located about halfway along the length of the cranium. The kidney-shaped eye sockets face forwards and outwards and are located on the back half of the cranium. The sclerotic rings are composed of at least 16 individual elements, an unusually high number for a reptile. The temporal fenestrae (openings in the back of the cranium) are enlarged, elliptical, and located on the cranium's rearmost quarter.[2] illustration of Peloneustes skulls seen from above and below Cranium of Peloneustes figured from below (left, NHMUK 3803) and above (right, NHMUK 2679) Characteristically, the premaxillae (front upper tooth-bearing bones) of Peloneustes bear six teeth each, and the diastemata (gaps between teeth) of the upper jaw are narrow. While it has been stated that Peloneustes had nasals (bones bordering the external nares), well-preserved specimens indicate that this is not the case. The frontals (bones bordering the eye sockets) of Peloneustes contact both the eye sockets and the external nares, a distinctive trait of Peloneustes. There has been some contention as to whether or not Peloneustes had lacrimals (bones bordering the lower front edges of the eye sockets), due to poor preservation. However, well preserved specimens indicate that the lacrimals are distinct bones as in other pliosaurids, as opposed to extensions of the jugals (bones bordering the lower rear edges of the eye sockets). The palate of Peloneustes is flat and bears many openings, including the internal nares (the opening of the nasal passage into the mouth). These openings are contacte
