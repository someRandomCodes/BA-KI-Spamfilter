<p><b style="font: 9px DilleniaUPC; color: #4863A0;">Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.She always had an interesting perspective on why the world must be flat.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.is the day I&#39;ll finally know what brick tastes like.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.back tomorrow; I will see if the book has arrived.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.In that instnt, everything changed.It was the first time he had ever seen someone cook dinner on an elephant.Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that&#39;s where the people are.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.His mind was blown that there was nothing in space except space itself.The knives were out and she was sharpening hers.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best , but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.Courage and stupidity were ll he had.As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.She was sad to hear that fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat loss, and pesticides.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.I checked to make sure that he was still alive.Nobody has encountered an explosive daisy and lived to tell the tale.The rain pelted the windshield as the darkness engulfed us.She opened up her third bottle of wine of the night.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px DilleniaUPC; color: #4863A0;">She is happy until she finds something to be unhappy about; then, she is overjoyed.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.Dan took the deep dive down the rabbit hole.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.It&#39;s not possible to convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising it infinite bananas when they die.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.She could hear him in the shower singing with a joy she hoped he&#39;d retain after she delivered the news.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.He understood why what, when, and where left out who.Choosing to do nothing is still a choice, after .Courage and stupidity were ll he had.Jenny made the announcement that her baby was an alien.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.There&#39;s a growing trend among teenagers of using frisbees as go-cart wheels.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.There&#39;s probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium.The thunderous roar of the jet overhead confirmed her worst fears.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.He kept telling himself that one day it would ll somehow make sense.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.Chocolate covered crickets were his favorite snack.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.Tody arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.Abstraction is often one floor above you.Traveling became almost extinct during the pandemic.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px DilleniaUPC; color: #4863A0;">they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.His mind was blown that there was nothing in space except space itself.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.Warm beer on a cold day isn&#39;t my idea of fun.The blinking lights of the antenna tower came into focus just as I heard a loud snap.He was % into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.The chic gangster liked to start the day with a pink scarf.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.It&#39;s always a good idea to seek shelter from the evil gaze of the sun.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.Tom got a small piece of pie.The teenage boy was accused of breaking his arm simply to out of the test.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.Imagine his surprise when he discovered that the safe was full of pudding.She let the balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.tell me you don&#39;t work in a morgue.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.Fluffy pink unicorns are a popular status symbol among macho men.He learned the hardest lesson of his lif and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.Karen believed al trafic laws should be obeyed by ll except herself.you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.The door swung to reveal pink giraffes and red elephants.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.</b></p>
