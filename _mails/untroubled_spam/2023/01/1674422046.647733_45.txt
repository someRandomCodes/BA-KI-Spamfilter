<p><b style="font: 5px Book Antiqua; color: #2F4F4F;">He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.The hummingbird&#39;s wings blurred while it eagerly sipped the sugar water from the feeder.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.I liked their first two albums but changed my mind after that charity gig.You have every right to be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to be mean.Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy everyone.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.As you consider the possible ways to improve yourself and the world, you notice John Travolta seems fairly unhappy.He decided water-skiing on a frozen lake wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.I&#39;m not a party animal, but I do like animal parties.The urgnt care center was flooded with patients after the news of a ne deadly virus was made public.As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.He had decided to accept his fate of accepting his fate.When motorists sped in and out of , she could think of was those in need of a transplant.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.Greetings from the real universe.The Guinea fowl flies through the air with the grace of a turtle.With a single flip of the coin, his changed forever.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.Green should have smelled more tranquil, but somehow it just tasted rotten.She was by the large chunks of ice washing up on the beach.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?Three generations with six decades of experience.There&#39;s an art to getting your way, and spitting olive pits across the table isn&#39;t it.The sun had set and so had his dreams.Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe.Eating eggs on Thursday for choir practice was recommended.He is no James Bond; his is Roger Moore.It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.</b></p><br />
