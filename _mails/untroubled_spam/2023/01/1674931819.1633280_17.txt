<p><b style="font: 8.5px Lucida Sans; color: #728FCE;">It was difficult for Mary to admit that most of her workout consisted of exercising poor judgment.Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can&#39;t read.We have been to Asia, nor have we visited Africa.The of a passed before him as he tried to decide between a cone or a cup.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.The secret ingredient to his was crime.The view from the lighthouse excited even the most seasoned traveler.You can&#39;t apples and oranges, but what about bananas and plantains?So long and thanks for the fish.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.I think I will the red car, or I will lease the blue one.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things the worse.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.Mothers spend months of their lives waiting on their children.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.Patricia found the meaning of in a bowl of Cheerios.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.She was the type of girl who wanted to live in a pink house.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.The river stole the gods.The shooter says goodbye to his love.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.The father handed each child a roadmap at the beginning of the 2-day road trip and explained it was so they could find their way .</b></p>
