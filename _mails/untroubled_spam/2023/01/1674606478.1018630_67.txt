<p><b style="font: 6px Snell Roundhan; color: #666362;">The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.He told us a very exciting adventure story.The delicious aroma from the kitchen was ruined by cigarette smoke.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.He spiked his hair green to support his iguana.He felt that dining on the bridge brought romance to his relationship with his cat.I am nevr at hom on Sundays.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of minerals.It would have been a better night if the guys next to us weren&#39;t in the splash zone.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.She looked at the masterpiece hanging in the museum but she could think is that her five-year-old could do better.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.Mary plays the piano.The body piercing didn&#39;t go exactly as he expected.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should Nair.The key lime pie is still up for debate.They ran around the corner to find that they had traveled back in time.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing my piggy on the same day!If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realFluffy pink unicorns are a popular status symbol among macho men.As the years pass by, we know owners look more and more like their dogs.More RVs were seen in the storage lot than at the campground.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.Three generations with six decades of experience.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.A quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months.It&#39;s been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.</b></p>
