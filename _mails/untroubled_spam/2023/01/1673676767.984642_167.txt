<p><b style="font: 9px AngsanaUPC; color: #FF6347;">Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.Improve your goldfish&#39;s physical fitness by getting him a bicycle.This is a Japanese doll.Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.He always wore his sunglasses at night.When he had to picnic on the beach, he purposely put sand in other people&rsquo;s food.He learned the hardest lesson of his life and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe.She can live her life however she wants as long as she listens to what I have to say.He is no James Bond; his name is Roger Moore.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.He wasn&#39;t bitter that she had moved on but from the radish.The sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law&#39;s bed.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide all the way to the deepest depths.She saw no irony asking me to change but wanting me to accept her for who she is.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.There&#39;s a growing trend among teenagers of using frisbees as go-cart wheels.The urgent care center was flooded with patients after the news of a new deadly virus was made public.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his friend go.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.his seven-layer cake only had six layers.I may struggle with geography, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m somewhere around here.She did her best to help him.He wondered if it could be called a beach if there was no sand.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.</b></p><br />

<p><b style="font: 9px AngsanaUPC; color: #FF6347;">He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.Nancy was proud that she ran a tight shipwreck.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but today wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.He put heat on the wound to see what would grow.My secretary is the only person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.Garlic ice-cream was her favorite.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.We have young kids who often walk into our room at night for various reasons including clowns in the closet.Just go ahead and press that button.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of all minerals.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.His son quipped that power bars were nothing more than adult candy bars.I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.Trash covered the landscape like sprinkles do a birthday cake.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing open my piggy bank on the same day!There&#39;s a message for you if you look up.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.Mr. Montoya knows the way to the bakery even though he&#39;s never been there.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.He had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.It was her first experience training a rainbow unicorn.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px AngsanaUPC; color: #FF6347;">The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.25 years later, she still regretted that specific moment.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is only a matter of time.The efficiency we have at removing trash has made creating trash more acceptable.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.The wake behind the boat told of the past while the open sea for told life in the unknown future.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.You have every right to be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to be mean.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.The white water rafting trip was suddenly halted by the unexpected brick wall.Hit me with your pet shark!Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.I&#39;m not a party animal, but I do like animal parties.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.Please tell me you don&#39;t work in a morgue.He figured a few sticks of dynamite were easier than a fishing pole to catch fish.The secret ingredient to his wonderful life was crime.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.She was too short to see over the fence.Too many prisons have become early coffins.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.</b></p>
