<p><b style="font: 10px Snell Roundhan; color: #413839;">There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.Behind the window was a reflection that only instilled fear.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.The bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny&#39;s head by mere millimeters.Instead of a bachelorette partyPeople keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.Lets all be unique together until we realise we are all the same.He decided to live his life by the big beats manifesto.Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.She wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead.While all her friends were positive that Mary had a sixth sense, she knew she actually had a seventh sense.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.I want more detailed information.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.I am never at home on Sundays.Beach-combing replaced wine tasting as his new obsession.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.Her scream silenced the rowdy teenagers.The bird had a belief that it was really a groundhog.25 years later, she still regretted that specific moment.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.It didn&#39;t take long for Gary to detect the robbers were amateurs.When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand and I still remember it quite vividly.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px Snell Roundhan; color: #413839;">There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.Nothing seemed out of place except the washing machine in the bar.She wasn&#39;t sure whether to be impressed or concerned that he folded underwear in neat little packages.He&#39;s in a boy band which doesn&#39;t make much sense for a snake.If eating three-egg omelets causes weight-gain, budgie eggs are a good substitute.He dreamed of leaving his law firm to open a portable dog wash.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this all about?This is the last random sentence I will be writing and I am going to stop mid-sentHe had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.He never understood why what, when, and where left out who.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.The pigs were insulted that they were named hamburgers.Tomatoes make great weapons when water balloons aren&rsquo;t available.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.She saw no irony asking me to change but wanting me to accept her for who she is.The knives were out and she was sharpening hers.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.He waited for the stop sign to turn to a go sign.Henry couldn&#39;t decide if he was an auto mechanic or a priest.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.It&#39;s never been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.They finished building the road they knew no one would ever use.They were excited to see their first sloth.The Great Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 10px Snell Roundhan; color: #413839;">Mary plays the piano.It took me too long to realize that the ceiling hadn&#39;t been painted to look like the sky.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.Imagine his surprise when he discovered that the safe was full of pudding.</b></p>
