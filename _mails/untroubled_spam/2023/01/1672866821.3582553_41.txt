Hey

Today, my good friend, Cody Bramlett, is doing something special for people on my email list - and you’re one of those people!
http://www.goldsurvey.email/10906-173-5130-33995/bruce/tindex10.html
You see, Cody believes in celebrating wins and he just found out this is a record breaking year for his supplement company.

And as a way to celebrate, he wants to give my email subscribers his special “Turmeric Refill” pricing that he only gives to people on his monthly subscription plan.

But today, he’s giving you the opportunity to get his refill pricing of Turmeric without signing up for our monthly subscription.
http://www.goldsurvey.email/10906-173-5130-33995/bruce/tindex11.html
That means there are no strings attached.

Why is he doing this?
http://www.goldsurvey.email/10906-173-5130-33995/bruce/tindex12.html
I asked him the same question and he said:

“If your loyal email subscribers like my turmeric with bioperine supplement as much as I know they will, then perhaps they’ll come back to us in the future and we’ll have another loyal customer for life!”

And don’t worry…

You won’t be charged again next month, next year, or ever again.

He’s simply giving you his “refill” pricing as a way to introduce himself.

But this special ends today or until they run out of bottles (whichever comes first).

>>Take advantage of Cody’s “Turmeric Refill” special until tonight.
David

In medieval times, it was customary in Continental Europe for a sovereign to grant almost regal powers of government to the feudal lords of his border districts to prevent foreign invasion. Those districts or manors were often called palatinates or counties palatine because the lord wielded the power of the king in his palace. His power was regal in kind but inferior in degree to that of the king.[4] That type of arrangement had caused many problems in Norman times for certain English border counties. Those territories were known as counties palatine and lasted at least in part to 1830 for good reason: remoteness, poor communications, governance carried out under difficult circumstances. The monarch and the government retained their usual right to separate head and body, figuratively or literally, at any time. (See also the hereditary title marquess.)[5] French examples In 1603, Henry IV, the King of France, granted Pierre Du Gua de Monts the exclusive right to colonize lands in North America st a latitude between 40° and 60° North. The King also gave Dugua a monopoly in the fur trade for those territories and named him Lieutenant General for Acadia and New France. In return, Dugua promised to bring 60 new colonists each year to what would be called Acadie. In 1607, the monopoly was revoked, and the colony failed, but in 1608, he sponsored Samuel de Champlain to open a colony at Quebec.[6] The Îles Glorieuses (Glorioso Islands) were on 2 March 1880 settled and named by the Frenchman Hippolyte Caltaux (b. 1847–d. 1907), who was their proprietor from until 1891. It was only on 23 August 1892 that they were claimed for the French Third Republic,
