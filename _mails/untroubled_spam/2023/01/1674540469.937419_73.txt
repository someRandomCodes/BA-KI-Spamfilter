Hey

Today, my good friend, Cody Bramlett, is doing something special for people on my email list - and you’re one of those people!

You see, Cody believes in celebrating wins and he just found out this is a record breaking year for his supplement company.
http://www.turmericc.shop/11179-173-5252-33995/bruce/tindex9.html
And as a way to celebrate, he wants to give my email subscribers his special “Turmeric Refill” pricing that he only gives to people on his monthly subscription plan.

But today, he’s giving you the opportunity to get his refill pricing of Turmeric without signing up for our monthly subscription.

That means there are no strings attached.
http://www.turmericc.shop/11179-173-5252-33995/bruce/tindex10.html
Why is he doing this?

I asked him the same question and he said:

“If your loyal email subscribers like my turmeric with bioperine supplement as much as I know they will, then perhaps they’ll come back to us in the future and we’ll have another loyal customer for life!”

And don’t worry…

You won’t be charged again next month, next year, or ever again.
http://www.turmericc.shop/11179-173-5252-33995/bruce/tindex11.html
He’s simply giving you his “refill” pricing as a way to introduce himself.

But this special ends today or until they run out of bottles (whichever comes first).

>>Take advantage of Cody’s “Turmeric Refill” special until tonight.
David






The Venetians were taken by surprise when the city fell; the fleet under Morosini was still sailing off the western coast of Greece. Following their customary strategy, they reacted by sending their fleet to blockade Gallipoli and cut off passage of the Dardanelles.[122] However, the Republic was by now ready to disengage itself from this profitless venture,[i] and soon instructed Morosini to seek peace.[125] In July, Hamza Bey signed a peace treaty with the Venetians (ratified on 4 September) whereby Venice recognized its loss of Thessalonica, restored passage of the Dardanelles, and acknowledged Ottoman overlordship over Patras in the Morea, with an annual tribute of 236 ducats. In exchange, the Venetians secured the Sultan's recognition of their possessions in Albania: Durazzo, Scutari, and Antivari.[122] Following the capture of Thessalonica, the Ottomans went on to extend their rule over western Greece. A few months after the fall of the city Ioannina surrendered to Hamza Bey and Carlo II Tocco accepted Ottoman suzerainty over the southern remnant of the Despotate of Epirus around Arta. Venice moved to place Tocco's island possessions of Zante, Cephalonia, and Leucas under her protection.[126] As a result, for the next half-century, until the end of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1479, the main arena of confrontation between Venice and the Ottomans was to be Albania, an area of vital importance to both powers, as from there the Ottomans could threaten Italy herself.[127] Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until October 1912, when it was captured by the Kingdom of Greece during the First Balkan War.[128][129] Its remaining Muslim population left the city during the Greco-Turkish population exchange i
