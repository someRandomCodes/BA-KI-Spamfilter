<p><b style="font: 5px UD Digi KyoKasho N-R; color: #0000ff;">The wooden spoon couldn&rsquo;t cut but left emotional scars.She was made the society president because she can whistle with her toes.He wore the surgical mask in public not to keep from catching a virus, but to keep people away from him.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.I checked to make sure that he was still alive.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.He dreamed of eating green apples with worms.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.Her in the confines of the house became her normal.Nothing is as cautiously cuddly as a pet porcupine.The Tsunami wave crashed against the raised houses and broke the pilings as if they were toothpicks.She was too short to see over the fence.There&#39;s no reason a hula hoop can&#39;t also be a circus ring.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.She let the balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.He ran out of , so he had to playing poker.Pink horses galloped across the sea.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.I cheated while playing the darts tournament by using a longbow.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things the worse.Garlic ice-cream was her favorite.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px UD Digi KyoKasho N-R; color: #0000ff;">The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that&#39;s where the people are.Courage and stupidity were ll he had.His son quipped that power bars were nothing more than adult candy bars.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.It took him a month to finish the meal.I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains well.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.Garlic ice-cream was her favorite.Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.The door slammed on the watermelon.The miniature pet elephant became the envy of the neighborhood.Traveling became almost extinct during the pandemic.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.Twin 4-month-olds slept in the shade of the palm tree while the mother tanned in the sun.Don&#39;t piss in my garden and tell me you&#39;re trying to help my plants grow.I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but - I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.She moved forward nly because she trusted that the ending she no was going through must be followed by a ne beginning.In that instnt, everything changed.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.I enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.On each full moonI honestly find her about as intimidating as a basket of kittens.He liked to play with words in the bathtub.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px UD Digi KyoKasho N-R; color: #0000ff;">The blinking lights of the antenna tower came into focus just as I heard a loud snap.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.The thunderous roar of the jet overhead confirmed her worst fears.Of course, she loves her pink bunny slippers.I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.Just go ahead and press that button.The estate agent quickly marked out his territory on the dance floor.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.With a single flip of the coin, his changed forever.The external scars tell part of the story.The father died during childbirth.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.She was too busy always talking about what she wanted to do to actually do any of it.I&#39;m confused: when people ask me what&#39;s up, and I point, they groan.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.They were excited to see their first sloth.This is a Japanese doll.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.As he dangled from the rope deep inside the crevasseI thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.People generally approve of dogs eating cat food but not cats eating dog food.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best , but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px UD Digi KyoKasho N-R; color: #0000ff;">The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.He liked to play with words in the bathtub.Thigh-high in the water, the fisherman&rsquo;s hope for dinner turned to despair.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.The chic gangster liked to start the day with a pink scarf.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.The pigs were insulted that they were named hamburgers.As time wore on, simple dog commands turned into full paragraphs explaining why the dog couldn&rsquo;t do something.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide the way to the deepest depths.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.The anaconda was the greatest criminal mastermind in this part of the neighborhood.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.There is no better feeling than staring at a wall with closed eyes.We need to rent a room for our party.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.Love is not like pizza.Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can&#39;t read.Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that&#39;s where the people are.You can&#39;t apples and oranges, but what about bananas and plantains?She could hear him in the shower singing with a joy she hoped he&#39;d retain after she delivered the news.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.Flesh-colored yoga pants were far worse than even he feared.His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.[TEXTSPIN:It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.|It would have been a better night if the guys next to us weren&#39;t in the splash zone.|The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.|It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.|Martha came to the conclusion that shake weights are agreat gift for any occasion.|The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to
