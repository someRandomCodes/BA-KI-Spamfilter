<p><b style="font: 8px Bookman; color: #413839;">I heard something and unmemorable.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things the worse.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.Whenever he saw a red flag warning at the beach he grabbed his surfboard.Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.You should nver take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.There were a lot of paintings of monkeys waving bamboo sticks in the gallery.Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.He used to confused between soldiers and shoulders, but as a military man, he soldiers responsibility.Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin.Tuesdays are fre if you bring a gnome costume.Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy everyone.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.When confronted with a rotary dial the teenager was perplexed.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?Having no hair made him look even hairier.It was the sandcastle he had ever seen.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.It&#39;s difficult to understand the lengths he&#39;d go to remain short.She looked at the masterpiece hanging in the museum but she could think is that her five-year-old could do better.The efficiency we have at removing trash has made creating trash more acceptable.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.He embraced his as an eggplant.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8px Bookman; color: #413839;">They were excited to see their first sloth.The heatBe careful with that butter knife.Blue sounded too cold at the time and yet it seemed to work for gin.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.No matter how beautiful the sunset, it saddened her knowing she was one day older.Nobody has encountered an explosive daisy and lived to tell the tale.I ate a sock because people on the Internet told me to.He said he was not there yesterday; however, many people saw him there.The bees decided to have a mutiny against their queen.Twin 4-month-olds slept in the shade of the palm tree while the mother tanned in the sun.As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.He ended up burning his fingers poking someone else&#39;s fire.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.Sometimes it is better to just walk away from things and go back to them later when you&rsquo;re in a better frame of mind.Garlic ice-cream was her favorite.That was how he came to 1 .A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.They got there early, and they got really good seats.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.When he encountered maize for the first time, he thought it incredibly corny.Situps are a terrible way to end your day.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide the way to the deepest depths.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.It&#39;s always a good idea to seek shelter from the evil gaze of the sun.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8px Bookman; color: #413839;">Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to milk.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.You should nver take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.I enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.He didn&rsquo;t want to go to the dentist, yet he went anyway.She moved forward nly because she trusted that the ending she no was going through must be followed by a ne beginning.At lastHe had decided to accept his fate of accepting his fate.I want to a onesie&hellip; but know it &rsquo;t suit me.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.The Guinea fowl flies through the air with the grace of a turtle.The bread dough reminded her of Santa Clause&rsquo;s belly.The miniature pet elephant became the envy of the neighborhood.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.Greetings from the real universe.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.</b></p>
