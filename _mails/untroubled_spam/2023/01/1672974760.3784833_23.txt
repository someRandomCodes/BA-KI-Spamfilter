he Brazza's martin nests singly or in loose colonies with sometimes widely separated burrows. The nest is a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry grass at the end of a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel. The normal clutch is three white eggs. The eggs measure 18.5 x 11.25 mm (0.73 x 0.49 in) and weigh 1.5 g (0.05 oz). The incubation and fledging times are unknown,[3] although as with all hirundines the chicks are altricial, hatching naked and blind.[23] As with other swallows, Brazza's martin feeds on flying insects, including termites, and may hunt over rivers or open savanna.[3] It can occur in single-species flocks or with other swallows including barn swallows, lesser striped swallows,[1][16] or rock martins.[17] Status There has been little ornithological research in this part of Africa, and until 2008 the Brazza's martin was classified as Data Deficient.[1] It was thought to have a much more restricted distribution range, but a 2007 paper presented evidence that extended its known range by 500 km (300 mi) to the north and 175 km (90 mi) southwards, a quadrupling of the area.[16] It has a large range of 402,000 km2 (155,000 sq mi) although the total population is unknown. Its extensive range and apparently stable population means this bird is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.[24] It is likely that this species is dug out for food by humans, but its small, dispersed colonies in firm soil suggest that it is a less rewarding target than the densely packed sandbank nests of species such as the African river martin and rosy bee-eater.[16] Breeding colonies in river sandbars are liable to flooding,[1] but neither natural causes nor hunting appears to be having a serious impact, and this species seems under no immediate threat. Its ability to use degraded habitats also aids its survival.[24] The Brazza's martin is not a protecte
