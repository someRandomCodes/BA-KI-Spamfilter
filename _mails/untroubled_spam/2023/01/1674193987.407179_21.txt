n 2016 Patrice Talon was elected president, with Benin then widely seen as an example of democracy on the African continent.[3] However, the April 2019 legislative elections led to a major crisis. Only two parties, both of which supported Talon, were allowed to complete (the Progressive Union and the Republican Bloc), with opposition lists failing validation after the implementation of a more restrictive electoral code by the government. The opposition, civil society and NGOs such as Amnesty International denounced what they considered to be an authoritarian drift by the government, damaging the country's democratic reputation.[3][4][5] The conduct of the legislative elections was criticised, including the government cutting off access to the internet and social networks during the vote, and the arrest of opponents and journalists in the months leading up to election day.[6][7][8] As expected, the elections saw a low turnout, with only 27% of voters voting. The Progressive Union won an absolute majority with 47 seats, while the Republican Bloc won the remaining 36.[9] Several post-election demonstrations led to violence between police and demonstrators, as well as significant material damage and at least two deaths.[10] The police and army intervene to disperse barricades erected in several streets of the capital Cotonou, including via live fire, causing one death.[11][12] Political dialogue was held for six months after the
