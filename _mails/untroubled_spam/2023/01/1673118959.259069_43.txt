Charles's officials continued to ascertain his rights,[33] visiting each town and holding public enquiries to obtain information about all claims.[33] The count's salt monopoly (or gabelle) was introduced in the whole county.[33] Income from the salt trade made up about 50% of state revenues by the late 1250s.[33] Charles abolished local tolls and promoted shipbuilding and grain trade.[34] He ordered the issue of new coins, called provencaux, to enable the use of the local currency in smaller transactions.[35] Emperor Frederick II, who was also the ruler of Sicily, died in 1250. The Kingdom of Sicily, also known as the Regno, included the island of Sicily and southern Italy nearly as far as Rome. Pope Innocent IV claimed that the Regno had reverted to the Holy See.[36] The Pope first offered it to Richard of Cornwall, but Richard did not want to fight against Frederick's son, Conrad IV of Germany.[36] Then the Pope proposed to enfeoff Charles with the kingdom.[36] Charles sought instructions from Louis IX, who forbade him to accept the offer, because he regarded Conrad as the lawful ruler.[36] After Charles informed the Holy See on 30 October 1253 that he would not accept the Regno, the Pope offered it to Edmund of Lancaster.[37] Queen Blanche, who had administered France during Louis' crusade,[32] died on 1 December 1252.[38] Louis made Alphonse and Charles co-regents, so that he could remain in the Holy Land.[39] Margaret II, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut had come into conflict with her son by her first marriage, John of Avesnes.[40] After her sons by her second marriage were captured in July 1253, she needed foreign assistance to secure their release.[41][42] Ignoring Louis IX's 1246 ruling that Hainaut should pass to John, she promised the county to Charles.[41] He accepted the offer and invaded Hainaut, forcing most local noblemen
