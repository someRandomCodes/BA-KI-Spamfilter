<p><b style="font: 9px Copperplate Gothic Bold; color: #565051;">The view from the lighthouse excited even the most seasoned traveler.The rusty nail stood erect, angled at a 45-degree angle, just waiting for the barefoot to come along.She was made the society president because she can whistle with her toes.In that instnt, everything changed.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Copperplate Gothic Bold; color: #565051;">At that moment she realized she had a sixth sense.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.When confronted with a rotary dial the teenager was perplexed.It would have been a better night if the guys next to us weren&#39;t in the splash zone.The newly planted trees were held up by wooden frames in hopes they could survive the next storm.He put heat on the wound to see what would grow.8 of 25 is the same as 25 of 8 and one of them is much easier to do in your head.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.She advised him to come back at once.The random sentence generator generated a random sentence about a random sentence.Swim at your own risk was taken as a challenge for the group of Kansas City college students.He went back to the video to see what had been recorded and was shocked at what he saw.Rock music approaches at high velocity.I&#39;d always thought lightning was something I could see.The wooden spoon couldn&rsquo;t cut but left emotional scars.He learned the hardest lesson of his lif and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.The lyrics of the song sounded like fingernails on a chalkboard.The tortoise jumped into the lake with dreams of becoming a sea turtle.Buried deep in the snow, he hoped his batteries were fresh in his avalanche beacon.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.The water flowing down the river didn&rsquo;t look that powerful from the carIt&#39;s not possible to convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising it infinite bananas when they die.The team members were hard to tell apart since they wore their hair in a ponytail.Mr. Montoya knows the way to the bakery even though he&#39;s been there.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Copperplate Gothic Bold; color: #565051;">He had concluded that pigs must be able to fly in Hog Heaven.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.The clock within this blog and the clock on my laptop are 1 hour different from each other.The Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.He walked into the basement with the horror movie from the night before playing in his head.We have been to Asia, nor have we visited Africa.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes the same things that I do.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.There are few things better in than a slice of pie.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.When transplanting seedlings, candied teapots will make the task easier.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.Just go ahead and press that button.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.The father handed each child a roadmap at the beginning of the 2-day road trip and explained it was so they could find their way .Shingle color was not something the couple had ever talked about.The elephant didn&#39;t want to talk about the person in the room.There were a lot of paintings of monkeys waving bamboo sticks in the gallery.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Copperplate Gothic Bold; color: #565051;">As the rental car rolled to a on the dark road, her fear increased by the moment.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.He was the of the club who didn&#39;t like plum pudding.Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that&#39;s where the people are.It must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that&#39;s where the people are.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.She looked into the mirror and saw another person.When confronted with a rotary dial the teenager was perplexed.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain of her strangeness.When was tight, he&#39;d his lunch from the local wishing well.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.They called out her time and again, but were met with nothing but silence.I don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.Nancy thought the way to create a welcoming was to line it with barbed wire.He&#39;s in a boy band which doesn&#39;t make much sense for a snake.I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realI like to work after my eight-hour tea-break.</b></p>
