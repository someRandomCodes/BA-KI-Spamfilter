h: 100%">The brain then is that which allows the mind to adjust itself exac=
tly to circumstances It is the organ of attention to life Should it become =
deranged however slightly the mind is no longer fitted to the circumstances=
 it wanders dreams Many forms of mental alienation are nothing else But fro=
m this it results that one of the rles of the brain is to limit the vision =
of the 12 mind to render its action more efficacious This is what we observ=
e in regard to the memory where the rle of the brain is to mask the useless=
 part of our past in order to allow only the useful remembrances to appear =
Certain useless recollections or dream remembrances manage nevertheless to =
appear also and to form a vague fringe around the distinct recollections It=
 would not be at all surprising if perceptions of the organs of our senses =
useful perceptions were the result of a selection or of a canalization work=
ed by the organs of our senses in the interest of our action but that there=
 should yet be around those perceptions a fringe of vague perceptions capab=
le of becoming more distinct in extraordinary abnormal cases Those would be=
 precisely the cases with which psychical research would deal<br /> <br /> =
This conception of mental action forms as will be seen the foundation of th=
e theory of dreams which Professor Bergson first presented in a lecture bef=
ore the Institut psychologique March 26 1901 It was published in the Revue =
scientifique of June 8 1901 An English translation revised by the author an=
d printed in The Independent of October 23 and 30 1913 here appears for the=
 first time in book form<br /> <br /> In this essay Professor Bergson made =
several contributions to our knowledge of dreams He showed in the first pla=
ce that dreaming is not so unlike the ordinary process of perception as had=
 been hitherto supposed Both use sense impressions as crude material to be =
molded and defined by the aid of memory images Here too he set forth the id=
ea which he so far as 13 I know was the first to formulate that sleep is a =
state of disinterestedness a theory which has since been adopted by several=
 psychologists In this address also was brought into consideration for the =
first time the idea that the self may go through different degrees of tensi=
on?a theory referred to in his Matter and Memory<br /> <br /> Its chief int=
erest for the general reader will however lie in the explanation it gives h=
im of the cause of some of his familiar dreams He may by practice become th=
e interpreter of his own visions and so come to an understanding of the vag=
aries of that mysterious and inseparable companion his dreamself<br /> <br =
/> DREAMS The subject which I have to discuss here is so complex it raises =
so many questions of all kinds difficult obscure some psychological others =
physiological and metaphysical in order to be treated in a complete manner =
it requires such a long development?and we have so little space that I shal=
l ask your permission to dispense with all preamble to set aside unessentia=
ls and to go at once to the heart of the question<br /> <br /> A dream is t=
his I perceive objects and there is nothing there I see men I seem to speak=
 to them and I hear what they answer there is no one there and I have not s=
poken It is all as if real things and real persons were there then on wakin=
g all has disappeared both persons and things How does this happen<br /> <b=
r /> But first is it true that there is nothing there I mean is there not p=
