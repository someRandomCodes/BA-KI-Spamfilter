Mean temperatures in the region are below 0 °C (32 °F) but daily temperature fluctuations can reach 30 °C (54 °F) and insolation is intense.[57] Vegetation in the region is classified as a high desert vegetation.[57] It is bushy and relatively sparse, with thicker plant growth found at hot springs[107] and in the craters where humid soils occur, perhaps wetted by ascending vapour.[108] Annual precipitation is less than 200 millimetres per year (7.9 in/year)[109] and moisture in the region comes from the Amazon in the east.[110] This aridity is a consequence of the region being within the Andean Arid Diagonal, which separates the northern monsoon precipitation regime from the southern westerlies precipitation regime,[111] and the rain shadow of the Andes, which prevents eastern moisture from reaching the area.[112] The climate of the region has been arid since the Miocene but fluctuations in humidity occurred especially during the last glacial[4] and between 9,000–5,000 years ago when climate was wetter.[113] The aridity results in a good preservation of volcanic products.[26] Strong winds blow at Cerro Blanco.[47] Average windspeeds are unknown[9] owing to the lack of measurements in the thinly populated region[48] and there are contrasting reports on wind speed extremes[68] but gusts of 20–30 metres per second (66–98 ft/s) have been recorded in July[49] and wind speeds in early December 2010 regularly exceeded 9.2 metres per second (33 km/h).[114] Winds blow mainly from the northwest,[47] and have been stable in that orientation for the past 2 million years. This favoured the development of extensive aeolian landforms[115] although winds coming from other directions also play a role.[116] Thermal winds are generated b
