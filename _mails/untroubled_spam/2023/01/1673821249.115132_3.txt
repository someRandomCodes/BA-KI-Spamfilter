It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best , but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.The view from the lighthouse excited even the most seasoned traveler.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in oder to be with her.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.She was sad to hear that fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat loss, and pesticides.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.Beach-combing replaced wine tasting as his obsession.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Baskerville; color: #0020C2;">Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.She wore green lipstick like a fashion icon.He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.Peter found road kill an excellent way to on dinner.Peter found road kill an excellent way to on dinner.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.I hear that Nancy is very pretty.Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.Red is greener than purple, for sure.The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but - I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.He took one look at what was under the table and noped the hell out of there.He appeared to be confusingly perplexed.The white water rafting trip was suddenly halted by the unexpected brick wall.The thunderous roar of the jet overhead confirmed her worst fears.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.Tomorrow will bring something , so as a memory.I&#39;d always thought lightning was something I could see.He found his art progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.Tody arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Baskerville; color: #0020C2;">The Guinea fowl flies through the air with the grace of a turtle.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.His mind was blown that there was nothing in space except space itself.When confronted with a rotary dial the teenager was perplexed.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.Warm beer on a cold day isn&#39;t my idea of fun.Harrold felt confident that nobody would ever suspect his spy pigeon.He was % into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.The chic gangster liked to start the day with a pink scarf.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.When confronted with a rotary dial the teenager was perplexed.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.As the rental car rolled to a on the dark road, her fear increased by the moment.Sixty-Four comes asking for bread.He wondered if it could be called a beach if there was no sand.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.As she walked along the street and looked in the gutter, she realized facemasks had become the cigarette butts.She let the balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.We need to rent a room for our party.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.Andy loved to sleep on a bed of nails.Excitement replaced fear until the final moment.He learned the hardest lesson of his lif and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.The view from the lighthouse excited even the most seasoned traveler.Rock music approaches at high velocity.The efficiency we have at removing trash has made creating trash more acceptable.Lets be unique together until we realize we are the same.</b></p>
