						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What is a vehicle tracker?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quite simply, it&rsquo;s a small electronic box that fits inside your vehicle, which sends signals with details of where it is and what speed it is travelling at.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This super useful data comes from the GPS Satellite system, which also feeds position data on your vehicles to all your satnavs and devices.</span></p>





						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>In a word? Data. </i>These <a href="http://www.cutexposure.shop/nodecfohfas/fqirwp2805eosglq/CQVu64RijUr2n1IZEzhP4k58P75E7DZHACa9Xlek5mQ/O5eqDR7JW72ZU0HRkouuQ_ZsNCvh8ZZ8i78Ew1PdiruAR4US-HOwb-WnBRQtN_49xwYnjuYQulsowQ5lz2D0zLnlfpFKM6C6BvaX8HSk7IA">modern tracking systems</a> give you and your company huge amounts of powerful data that will let you run your fleet more efficiently &ndash; which means <i>saving a lot of money</i>.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Most importantly, you can also <a href="http://www.cutexposure.shop/nodecfohfas/fqirwp2805eosglq/CQVu64RijUr2n1IZEzhP4k58P75E7DZHACa9Xlek5mQ/O5eqDR7JW72ZU0HRkouuQ_ZsNCvh8ZZ8i78Ew1PdiruAR4US-HOwb-WnBRQtN_49xwYnjuYQulsowQ5lz2D0zLnlfpFKM6C6BvaX8HSk7IA">monitor driver behaviour data</a>, such as harsh acceleration and braking, time using the cruise control, pedal position, rpm bands, fuel consumption, and engine diagnostics. This nifty little device will stop your workers driving like maniacs in a flash!</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">And all of this rich telematics information is then fed back to you, directly on your PC or smart phone.</span></p>

<p><b style="font: 7px UD Digi KyoKasho N-R; color: #6698FF;">The bread dough reminded her of Santa Clause&rsquo;s belly.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.Thigh-high in the water, the fisherman&rsquo;s hope for dinner turned to despair.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.I often see the time 11:11 or 12:34 on clocks.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Choosing to do nothing is still a choice, after .The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.They ran around the corner to find that they had traveled back in time.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide the way to the deepest depths.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.He colored deep space a soft yellow.Sometimes you have to just give up and by cheating.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.I like to work after my eight-hour tea-break.When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand and I still remember it quite vividly.She wanted to be rescued, but if it was Tuesday and raining.He invested some skill points in Charisma and Strength.He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.Martha came to the conclusion that shake weights are agreat gift for any occasion.He shaved the peach to prove a point.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.While her friends were positive that Mary had a sixth sense, she knew she actually had a seventh sense.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7px UD Digi KyoKasho N-R; color: #6698FF;">I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realI was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but - I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.Jason lived his ife by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.You have every right to be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to be mean.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.The llama couldn&#39;t resist trying the lemonade.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.No matter how beautiful the sunset, it saddened her knowing she was one day older.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.Lucifer was surprised at the amount of at Death Valley.That must be the tenth time I&#39;ve been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars.She always speaks to him in a loud voice.It was a really good Monday for being a Saturday.Rock music approaches at high velocity.People generally approve of dogs eating cat food but not cats eating dog food.She had the gift of being able to paint songs.He had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.I&#39;m not a party animal, but I do like animal parties.I heard something and unmemorable.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.The toy brought back fond memories of being lost in the rain forest.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.Peanut butter and jelly caused the elderly lady to think about her past.She works two jobs to make ends meet; at least, that was her reason for not having time to join us.Potato wedges probably are not best for relationships.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.</b></p>
