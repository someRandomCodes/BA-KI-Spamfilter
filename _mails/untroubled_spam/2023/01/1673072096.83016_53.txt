<p><b style="font: 6px Kalinga; color: #625D5D;">He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.He set out for a short walk, but now all he could see were mangroves and water were for miles.He hated that he loved what she hated about hate.I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but today- I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.I liked their first two albums but changed my mind after that charity gig.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.The rusty nail stood erect, angled at a 45-degree angle, just waiting for the perfect barefoot to come along.The stranger officiates the meal.She couldn&#39;t decide of the glass was half empty or half full so she drank it.The virus had powers none of us knew existed.Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good environment for learning English.We have a lot of rain in June.The estate agent quickly marked out his territory on the dance floor.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.I used to practice weaving with spaghetti three hours a day but stopped because I didn&#39;t want to die alone.Mary plays the piano.The fog was so dense even a laser decided it wasn&#39;t worth the effort.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.You should never take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.The bread dough reminded her of Santa Clause&rsquo;s belly.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.He learned the hardest lesson of his life and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.Kevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.The old apple revels in its authority.You&#39;re unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 6px Kalinga; color: #625D5D;">The bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny&#39;s head by mere millimeters.They say people remember important moments in their life well, yet no one even remembers their own birth.At lastThe glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.Barking dogs and screaming toddlers have the unique ability to turn friendly neighbors into cranky enemies.He spiked his hair green to support his iguana.Tomatoes make great weapons when water balloons aren&rsquo;t available.Today is the day I&#39;ll finally know what brick tastes like.Now I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realIt was the best sandcastle he had ever seen.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the only way in or out.He colored deep space a soft yellow.She had convinced her kids that any mushroom found on the ground would kill them if they touched it.Red is greener than purple, for sure.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.He was 100% into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.As the rental car rolled to a stop on the dark road, her fear increased by the moment.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.People generally approve of dogs eating cat food but not cats eating dog food.She discovered van life is difficult with 2 cats and a dog.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.He found his art never progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.She finally understood that grief was her love with no place for it to go.She opened up her third bottle of wine of the night.Tuesdays are free if you bring a gnome costume.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.Shakespeare was a famous 17th-century diesel mechanic.She did a happy dance because all of the socks from the dryer matched.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 6px Kalinga; color: #625D5D;">Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.The book is in front of the table.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.He would only survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.I may struggle with geography, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m somewhere around here.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to get milk.The random sentence generator generated a random sentence about a random sentence.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.The sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law&#39;s bed.If eating three-egg omelets causes weight-gain, budgie eggs are a good substitute.He embraced his new life as an eggplant.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains life well.She wanted to be rescued, but only if it was Tuesday and raining.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.If you like tuna and tomato sauce, try combining the two, it&rsquo;s really not as bad as it sounds.Please wait outside of the house.Rock music approaches at high velocity.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his life.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.I had a friend in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.</b></p>
