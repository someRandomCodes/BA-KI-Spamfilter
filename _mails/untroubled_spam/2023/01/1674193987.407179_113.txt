In 1960, palaeontologist Lambert Beverly Tarlo published a review of pliosaurid species that had been reported from the Upper Jurassic. Many pliosaurids species had been named based on isolated fragments, creating confusion. Tarlo also found that inaccurate descriptions of the material and palaeontologists ignoring each other's work only made this confusion worse. Of the 36 species he reviewed, he found only nine of them to be valid, including Peloneustes philarchus.[7] In 2011, palaeontologists Hilary Ketchum and Roger Benson described the anatomy of the skull of Peloneustes. Since the previous anatomical studies of Andrews and Linder, more specimens had been found, including NHMUK R4058, a skull preserved in three dimensions, providing a better idea of the skull's shape.[2] Other assigned species Many further species have been assigned to Peloneustes throughout its history, but these have all since been reassigned to different genera or considered invalid.[2] In the same publication in which he named P. philarchus, Seeley also named another species of Plesiosaurus, P. sterrodeirus based on seven specimens in the Woodwardian Museum consisting of cranial and vertebral material.[3] When Lydekker erected the genus Peloneustes for P. philarchus, he also reclassified "Plesiosaurus" sterrodeirus and "Pleiosaurus" aequalis (a species named by John Phillips in 1871)[15]: 365 [7] as members of this genus.[8] In his 1960 review of pliosaurid taxonomy, Tarlo considered P. aequalis to be invalid, since it was based
