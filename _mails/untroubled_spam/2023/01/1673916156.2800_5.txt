The second round, which took place between 24 and 29 April, was played as best-of-25-frames matches spread over three sessions.[26] Defending champion Griffiths lost the first seven frames against Steve Davis, and ended the first session trailing 1–7.[34] Davis won the opening frame of the second session to extend his lead to 8–1, and had a seven frame lead again at 10–3, before Griffiths won three frames to end the session 6–10 behind.[40] In the third session, Griffiths won the first four frames to level at 10–10, with Davis then winning the next three to secure a 13–10 victory, which included a 116 break in the 22nd frame.[41] The failure of first-time world snooker champions to defend their title has become known as the "Crucible curse."[42] Higgins won six of the eight frames in each of the first two sessions against Perrie Mans,[34] and eliminated Mans 13–6.[43] Despite leading 4–1 after making breaks of 95 and 108 in consecutive frames,[43] former champion John Spencer lost in his first match for the third consecutive year, 8–13 to Stevens.[44] Virgo took an early lead of 4–1 against Eddie Charlton, with their first session finishing 4-4.[40] At 11–10 ahead, Virgo missed a pot on the brown, and Charlton then levelled the match 11–11.[33] The match went to a deciding frame, where Charlton made a break of 33, and Virgo missed a black that allowed Charlton back in to win 13–12.[45][41] The report in Snooker Scene characterised the match as one where the "famed tenacity" of Charlton overcame the "brittle, edgy side of Virgo's temperament."[33] Cliff Thorburn finished the first session against Mountjoy 3–5 behind.[46] In the evening, Thorburn played cards and drank alcohol with friends until 5:00 am, resuming the match by winning the first five frames in succession, and going on to win 13–10,[46] From 10 to 10 Thorburn won two frames on the pink and one on the black.[44] The match featured a 69-minute 18th frame, including 21 min
