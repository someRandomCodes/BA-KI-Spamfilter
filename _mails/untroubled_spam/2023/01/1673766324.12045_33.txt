<p><b style="font: 8px Yu Mincho; color: #2727dd;">There&#39;s a growing trend among teenagers of using frisbees as go-cart wheels.The manager of the fruit stand always sat and sold vegetables.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.The elephant didn&#39;t want to talk about the person in the room.Every manager should be able to recite at least ten nursery rhymes backward.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.She always had an interesting perspective on why the world must be flat.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.Every manager should be able to recite at least ten nursery rhymes backward.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his .They were excited to see their first sloth.They say people remember important moments in their well, yet no one even remembers their own birth.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.Mothers spend months of their lives waiting on their children.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.Gary didn&#39;t understand why Doug went upstairs to one dollar bills when he invited him to go cow tipping.Watching the geriatric men&rsquo;s softball team brought back memories of 3 yr olds playing t-ball.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.Lets be unique together until we realize we are the same.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.The rusty nail stood erect, angled at a 45-degree angle, just waiting for the barefoot to come along.He found the end of the rainbow and was surprised at what he found there.</b></p><br />

<p><b style="font: 8px Yu Mincho; color: #2727dd;">If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.The key lime pie is still up for debate.She learned that water bottles are no longer just to hold liquid, but they&#39;re also status symbols.You can&#39;t apples and oranges, but what about bananas and plantains?The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.He created a pig burger out of beef.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in oder to be with her.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.He uses onomatopoeia as a weapon of mental destruction.She couldn&#39;t decide of the glass was half empty or half full so she drank it.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.She wasn&#39;t sure whether to be impressed or concerned that he folded underwear in neat little packages.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.The rusty nail stood erect, angled at a 45-degree angle, just waiting for the barefoot to come along.The book is in front of the table.I&#39;ve traveled around Africa and still haven&#39;t found the gnu who stole my scarf.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.They looked up at the sky and saw a millin stars.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.Just go ahead and press that button.The hummingbird&#39;s wings blurred while it eagerly sipped the sugar water from the feeder.The door slammed on the watermelon.I&#39;m confused: when people ask me what&#39;s up, and I point, they groan.Pink horses galloped across the sea.The family&rsquo;s excitement over going to Disneyland was crazier than she anticipated.My uncle&#39;s favorite pastime was building cars out of noodles.</b></p>
