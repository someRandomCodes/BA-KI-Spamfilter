<p>Your prayers have been answered!</p>

<p>These genius researchers have finally found a way to kill the herpes virus for good and the way this works will knock your socks off!</p>

<p><a href="http://waterbath.social/0KT6MRuKyVzMhl4oyasNY1F2e_L_0IMcPdsTx8_uV1PiTaU"><b>You can find their discovery here.</b></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about an unknown substance that finds, attacks and kills the herpes virus which has been thought to be impossible until now!</p>
<a href="http://waterbath.social/0KT6MRuKyVzMhl4oyasNY1F2e_L_0IMcPdsTx8_uV1PiTaU"><img alt="" src="http://waterbath.social/a5c1c5e412f55eb465.jpg" width="300px" /> </a>

<p>And the way it works is mind blowing!</p>

<p><a href="http://waterbath.social/0KT6MRuKyVzMhl4oyasNY1F2e_L_0IMcPdsTx8_uV1PiTaU"><b>It literally obliterates both oral and genital herpes!</b></a></p>

<p>But hurry!</p>

<p>Due to the increasing number of requests, the research team is <b> considering taking down their findings </b>until a better way to share this information is found.</p>

<p>This is so incredible, that the academic community says these scientists are on their way to win a Nobel prize for this discovery.</p>

<p>Again, <a href="http://waterbath.social/0KT6MRuKyVzMhl4oyasNY1F2e_L_0IMcPdsTx8_uV1PiTaU"><b> hurry and get their findings from this page, while you still can.</b></a></p>

<p style="font-size:2px;color:white">5af_25f5aPeng Chang-kuei, a Chinese-born chef credited with creating the internationally popular dish General Tso&#39;s chicken, was yesterday announced to have died by his son. Chuck Peng told The Associated Press his father died of pneumonia in Taipei, Taiwan on Wednesday. The chef fled China to Taiwan in 1949 and invented the dish shortly thereafter. In the 1970s Peng opened a New York restaurant, which he claimed was a regular haunt of Henry Kissinger. Peng credited Kissinger with the dish&#39;s popularity. Peng conceived the famed dish, which is unknown in China, as unfried. Garlic and soy sauce provided flavour, as did chillies. Today the chicken is served across the US as fried chicken in a sweet, sticky sauce. The chillies remain, with broccoli also appearing. Peng named it after Zuo Zongtang from his native Hunan Province; Zongtang assisted in suppressing the 19th-century Taiping Rebellion. Peng said the meal was invented for a US admiral visiting Taiwan. Over three days, Peng was contracted to produce several banquets, with not one repeated dish. After exhausting traditional chicken dishes Peng said he created what became General Tso&#39;s chicken as an experiment. In later years he ran Peng&#39;s, a chain of Taiwanese restaurants. General Tso&#39;s chicken also remained popular across the US. His son claimed he remained working in the kitchen until a few months before his death, at 97. In a documentary two years ago, shown photos of General Tso&#39;s chicken served in the US in modern times, he remarked &quot;This is all crazy nonsense.&quot; <a href="http://waterbath.social/XgRSGoSAKMMpvteAHCEoZ54rm_VDcpmyK_Rn-cKnh7EPSA"><img src="http://waterbath.social/d05895754e1b6ddfd3.jpg" /></a></p>
