<p><b style="font: 5px Lucida Handwriting; color: #0041C2;">It isn&#39;t true that my mattress is made of cotton candy.Written warnings in instruction manuals are worthless since rabbits can&#39;t read.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.She traveled because it the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.She had convinced her kids that any mushroom found on the ground would kill them if they touched it.I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.As you consider the possible ways to improve yourself and the world, you notice John Travolta seems fairly unhappy.She was the type of girl who wanted to live in a pink house.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.A good example of a useful vegetable is medicinal rhubarb.That was how he came to 1 .I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good environment for learning English.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.The lake is a long way from .Flying fish flew by the space station.He waited for the sign to turn to a go sign.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.She was the type of girl who wanted to live in a pink house.Nothing is as cautiously cuddly as a pet porcupine.Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that&#39;s where the people are.She is happy until she finds something to be unhappy about; then, she is overjoyed.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.</b></p>
