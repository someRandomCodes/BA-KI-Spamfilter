<p><b style="font: 7.5px SimKai; color: #357EC7;">The urgent care center was flooded with patients after the news of a new deadly virus was made public.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.He always wore his sunglasses at night.The bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny&#39;s head by mere millimeters.Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.This is the last random sentence I will be writing and I am going to stop mid-sentI would have gotten the promotion, but my attendance wasn&rsquo;t good enough.I&#39;m confused: when people ask me what&#39;s up, and I point, they groan.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.Today arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.He is no James Bond; his name is Roger Moore.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to buy cigarettes.He had a vague sense that trees gave birth to dinosaurs.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.He decided to fake his disappearance to avoid jail.The anaconda was the greatest criminal mastermind in this part of the neighborhood.A kangaroo is really just a rabbit on steroids.People generally approve of dogs eating cat food but not cats eating dog food.The tortoise jumped into the lake with dreams of becoming a sea turtle.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.Lucifer was surprised at the amount of life at Death Valley.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.They looked up at the sky and saw a million stars.When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand and I still remember it quite vividly.There&#39;s probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.Douglas figured the best way to succeed was to do the opposite of what he&#39;d been doing all his life.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7.5px SimKai; color: #357EC7;">Hit me with your pet shark!People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one only knew how to play bongos.She wasn&#39;t sure whether to be impressed or concerned that he folded underwear in neat little packages.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.Don&#39;t piss in my garden and tell me you&#39;re trying to help my plants grow.He kept telling himself that one day it would all somehow make sense.After coating myself in vegetable oil I found my success rate skyrocketed.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.The white water rafting trip was suddenly halted by the unexpected brick wall.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.There were a lot of paintings of monkeys waving bamboo sticks in the gallery.The near-death experience brought new ideas to light.The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.He&#39;s in a boy band which doesn&#39;t make much sense for a snake.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.He colored deep space a soft yellow.I am my aunt&#39;s sister&#39;s daughter.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.They&#39;re playing the piano while flying in the plane.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.The balloons floated away along with all my hopes and dreams.The delicious aroma from the kitchen was ruined by cigarette smoke.He loved eating his bananas in hot dog buns.Karen realized the only way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.I want to buy a onesie&hellip; but know it won&rsquo;t suit me.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.Traveling became almost extinct during the pandemic.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7.5px SimKai; color: #357EC7;">Mary plays the piano.The old apple revels in its authority.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.Imagine his surprise when he discovered that the safe was full of pudding.</b></p>
