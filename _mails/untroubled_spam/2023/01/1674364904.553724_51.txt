						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What is a vehicle tracker?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quite simply, it&rsquo;s a small electronic box that fits inside your vehicle, which sends signals with details of where it is and what speed it is travelling at.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This super useful data comes from the GPS Satellite system, which also feeds position data on your vehicles to all your satnavs and devices.</span></p>





						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>In a word? Data. </i>These <a href="http://www.blueprecede.shop/wubme/jvfibqmxa4030ssnrbvt/oQ9xQycIHOWwpb33bRh6YBr_d8p_KLd3XjmajkEDWjY/MwUA_HENMsjdI5_pOOr5XZMZMdJxCWit4_3pQTq5CxyHMbFwCZKSAuDLYaI7Xubtcy1KxrVWpt-1CLXqXwzd-8j59FsQRkyDlst4DiQ9SLxIDdEKEb8nJlmU8NVvpImb">modern tracking systems</a> give you and your company huge amounts of powerful data that will let you run your fleet more efficiently &ndash; which means <i>saving a lot of money</i>.</span></p>

This nifty little device will stop your workers driving like maniacs in a flash!</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">And all of this rich telematics information is then fed back to you, directly on your PC or smart phone.</span></p>
