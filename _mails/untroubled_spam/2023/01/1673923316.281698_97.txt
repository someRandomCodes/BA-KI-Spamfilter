<p><b style="font: 6px Brushstroke; color: #566D7E;">she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.He wasn&#39;t bitter that she had moved on but from the radish.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.Flying fish flew by the space station.There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.The Japanese yen for commerce is still well-known.Shingle color was not something the couple had ever talked about.He created a pig burger out of beef.They finished building the road they knew no one would ever use.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.It&#39;s always a good idea to seek shelter from the evil gaze of the sun.The secret ingredient to his was crime.A glittering gem is not enough.It didn&#39;t make sense unless you had the power to eat colors.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe.The family&rsquo;s excitement over going to Disneyland was crazier than she anticipated.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.The father died during childbirth.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.Just go ahead and press that button.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his go.The family&rsquo;s excitement over going to Disneyland was crazier than she anticipated.He barked orders at his daughters but they just stared back with amusement.</b></p>
