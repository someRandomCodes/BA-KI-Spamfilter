<p><b style="font: 9px Westminster; color: #7B68EE;">Douglas figured best way to succeed was to do the opposite of what he&#39;d been doing his .Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.It&#39;s not often you find a soggy banana on the street.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.Cursive writing is thebest way to build a race track.The fence was confused about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out.I am my aunt&#39;s sister&#39;s daughter.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.As he dangled from the rope deep inside the crevasseHe told us a very exciting adventure story.He went back to the video to see what had been recorded and was shocked at what he saw.Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.When he asked her favorite number, she answered without hesitation that it was diamonds.Her scream silenced the rowdy teenagers.It caught him guard that space smelled of seared steak.You have no right to yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a lockpick.While her friends were positive that Mary had a sixth sense, she knew she actually had a seventh sense.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should Nair.He had a stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.He played the game as if his depended on it and the truth was that it did.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.Even with the snow falling outside, she felt it appropriate to wear her bikini.</b></p>
