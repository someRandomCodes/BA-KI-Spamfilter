<p><b style="font: 5px Malgun Gothic; color: #2727dd;">Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.The external scars tell only part of the story.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.Abstraction is often one floor above you.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.Karen believed all traffic laws should be obeyed by all except herself.Choosing to do nothing is still a choice, after all.Nobody loves a pig wearing lipstick.Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.Wisdom is easily acquired when hiding under the bed with a saucepan on your head.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide all the way to the deepest depths.Sixty-Four comes asking for bread.Jenny made the announcement that her baby was an alien.Twin 4-month-olds slept in the shade of the palm tree while the mother tanned in the sun.Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.Edith could decide if she should paint her teeth or brush her nails.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his friend go.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to buy cigarettes.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.He wondered if it could be called a beach if there was no sand.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Malgun Gothic; color: #2727dd;">It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.Despite multiple complications and her near-death experiencePeanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.Martha came to the conclusion that shake weights are a great gift for any occasion.Garlic ice-cream was her favorite.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.He had a vague sense that trees gave birth to dinosaurs.He kept telling himself that one day it would all somehow make sense.There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have money to go to the store.The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.Greetings from the galaxy MACS0647-JD, or what we call home.Be careful with that butter knife.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.You bite up because of your lower jaw.They ran around the corner to find that they had traveled back in time.There&#39;s a message for you if you look up.Malls are great places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.She wanted to be rescued, but only if it was Tuesday and raining.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.Nothing seemed out of place except the washing machine in the bar.Mr. Montoya knows the way to the bakery even though he&#39;s never been there.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.The fox in the tophat whispered into the ear of the rabbit.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.He had a hidden stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Malgun Gothic; color: #2727dd;">The best key lime pie is still up for debate.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.The opportunity of a lifetime passed before him as he tried to decide between a cone or a cup.She used her own hair in the soup to give it more flavor.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.The wake behind the boat told of the past while the open sea for told life in the unknown future.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.He had reached the point where he was paranoid about being paranoid.Jason didn&rsquo;t understand why his parents wouldn&rsquo;t let him sell his little sister at the garage sale.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in order to be with her.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.The lake is a long way from here.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.I&#39;m not a party animal, but I do like animal parties.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.Please tell me you don&#39;t work in a morgue.The sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law&#39;s bed.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.She folded her handkerchief neatly.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.</b></p>
