I write to inform you that i have tried to get in touch with you over the t=
elephone without any luck of 

speaking with you, and i decided to send you this email for your perusals.I=
 know you must be suprise at this 

development, but i choose to tell you the truth because of my sincere wish =
to every man , as i would expect to 

be treated. After a thorough investigation on your contract payment file by=
 the Presidency,Federal Republic Of 

Nigeria, I discovered that it would take a long process for your contract f=
unds to be released to you through 

Telegraphic Transfer Or Certified International Bank Draft due to some irre=
gularities detected on your file. 

Also be aware that during our investigations,we found out that you have spe=
nt so much money in trying to 

realize your contract payment with the Federal Republic Of Nigeria,which di=
d not even reflect in your file. 
 
Based on this, i made a secretive arrangement in regards of the shipment of=
 your contract sum, I wish to inform 

you that all necessary modalities have been automatically concluded and to =
left Nigeria to London via your 

Country  by Express Cargo Flight.
 
Note carefully that the content of the crate is =93MONEY=94 but it was not =
disclosed to the Courier Services as 

Money, rather I informed them that the crate contain vital =93DIPLOMATIC DO=
CUMENTS=94 belonging to my client 

(that=92s you).
 
Furthermore, the weight of the consignment is 220kg but I manage to pay 120=
kg, which cost US$35,600.00. On no 

account should you disclose the content of the crate with the Diplomatic Co=
urier Services for fear of betrayal. 

So do not allow them to know that the content is money.
 
In the meantime, contact the Standard Security & Diplomatic Courier Service=
s on Tel: 234- 9072388763, Email: 

( sssdcs000@outlook.com )   Attn: George Efuech urgently to know the actual=
 situation with the 

consignment and also give them your address where the consignment will be d=
elivered and then get back to me as 

soon as possible so that I can give you the shipment document.
 
Meanwhile, I will be coming over to your country immediately the consignmen=
t arrives in your country for my 10% 

share.
 
Congrats and remain blessed.
 
Best regards.
