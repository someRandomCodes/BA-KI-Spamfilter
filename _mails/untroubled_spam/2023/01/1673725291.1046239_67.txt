<p><b style="font: 9px Symbol; color: #4863A0;">When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.People generally approve of dogs eating cat food but not cats eating dog food.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.He created a pig burger out of beef.Mom didn&rsquo;t understand why no one else wanted a hot tub full of jello.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.Chocolate covered crickets were his favorite snack.You&#39;re unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.She always had an interesting perspective on why the world must be flat.The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.You have no right to yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a lockpick.Behind the window was a reflection that instilled fear.They were excited to see their first sloth.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.She could hear him in the shower singing with a joy she hoped he&#39;d retain after she delivered the news.Sometimes you have to just give up and by cheating.The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable.It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.It&#39;s always a good idea to seek shelter from the evil gaze of the sun.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.Dan ate the clouds like cotton candy.More RVs were seen in the storage lot than at the campground.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.</b></p><br />
