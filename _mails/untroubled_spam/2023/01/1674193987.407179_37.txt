<p><b style="font: 7px Microsoft Tai Le; color: #357EC7;">Situps are a terrible way to end your day.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.You can&#39;t apples and oranges, but what about bananas and plantains?Her hair was windswept as she rode in the black convertible.There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.The thick foliage and intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible.Mr. Montoya knows the way to the bakery even though he&#39;s been there.they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.She did a happy dance because of the socks from the dryer matched.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in oder to be with her.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.He uses onomatopoeia as a weapon of mental destruction.Having no hair made him look even hairier.The fog was so dense even a laser decided it wasn&#39;t worth the effort.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.Andy loved to sleep on a bed of nails.she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.He was business when he wore his clown suit.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it to them.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.The hummingbird&#39;s wings blurred while it eagerly sipped the sugar water from the feeder.He drank before spitting it out.I&#39;m confused: when people ask me what&#39;s up, and I point, they groan.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will need a shrink.The wooden spoon couldn&rsquo;t cut but left emotional scars.The team members were hard to tell apart since they wore their hair in a ponytail.</b></p>
