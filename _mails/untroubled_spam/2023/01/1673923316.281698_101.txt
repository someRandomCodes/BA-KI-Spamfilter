Hip flexors is the longest muscle in the body and the only muscle that connects the upper body and lower body, also known as the psoas (pronounced so-az).

Your psoas...

…stabilize your trunk and spine during movement and sitting

…allow you to bend your hips and legs towards your chest

…support your internal organs

…is connected to your diaphragm which allows you to walk and breathe.

In other words, your psoas has a direct influence on your fight or flight response!

If the psoas get tight and weak, it can be a real pain but working certain muscles and doing the certain exercise combinations provide easy fixes.

To your better health,
