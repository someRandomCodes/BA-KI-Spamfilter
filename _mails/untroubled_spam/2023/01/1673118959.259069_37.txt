e chicks of passerines are altricial: blind, featherless, and helpless when hatched from their eggs. Hence, the chicks require extensive parental care. Most passerines lay colored eggs, in contrast with nonpasserines, most of whose eggs are white except in some ground-nesting groups such as Charadriiformes and nightjars, where camouflage is necessary, and in some parasitic cuckoos, which match the passerine host's egg.

Clutches vary considerably in size: some larger passerines of Australia such as lyrebirds and scrub-robins lay only a single egg, most smaller passerines in warmer climates lay between two and five, while in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, hole-nesting species like tits can lay up to a dozen and other species around five or six.

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey </span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, my good friend, Cody Bramlett, is doing something special for people on my email list - and you&rsquo;re one of those people!</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, Cody believes in celebrating wins and he just found out this is a record breaking year for his supplement company.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as a way to celebrate, he wants to give my email subscribers his special <strong>&ldquo;Turmeric Refill&rdquo;</strong> pricing that he </span><strong><em>only </em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">gives to people on his monthly subscription plan.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But today, he&rsquo;s giving you the opportunity to get his refill pricing of Turmeric </span><a href="http://buzzbgonez.shop/2IGlYsSPrOQ5K9_l2bL_j8RKEh4zCCABIG3BNzfzfHG_YLVd" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank"><strong><em>without </em></strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">signing up for our monthly subscription.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means there are no strings attached.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is he doing this?</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://buzzbgonez.shop/2IGlYsSPrOQ5K9_l2bL_j8RKEh4zCCABIG3BNzfzfHG_YLVd" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank"><strong>I asked him the same question and he said:</strong></a></span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&ldquo;If your loyal email subscribers like my turmeric with bioperine supplement as much as I know they will, then perhaps they&rsquo;ll come back to us in the future and we&rsquo;ll have another loyal customer for life!&rdquo;</i></span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won&rsquo;t be charged again next month, next year, or ever again.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&rsquo;s simply giving you his &ldquo;refill&rdquo; pricing as a way to introduce himself.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this special ends today or until they run out of bottles (whichever comes first).</span></p>
