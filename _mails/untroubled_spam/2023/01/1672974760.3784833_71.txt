<p><b style="font: 5px Shruti; color: #4863A0;">He dreamed of eating green apples with worms.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.All she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.I&#39;m a great listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and all that, but I hate people.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.Love is not like pizza.There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.Everything was going so well until I was accosted by a purple giraffe.As you consider all the possible ways to improve yourself and the world, you notice John Travolta seems fairly unhappy.Choosing to do nothing is still a choice, after all.He went on a whiskey diet and immediately lost three days.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.Tomorrow will bring something new, so leave today as a memory.The sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law&#39;s bed.Never underestimate the willingness of the greedy to throw you under the bus.Sixty-Four comes asking for bread.Jenny made the announcement that her baby was an alien.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.Having no hair made him look even hairier.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.his seven-layer cake only had six layers.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to buy cigarettes.He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.Today I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Shruti; color: #4863A0;">It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.She wanted to be rescued, but only if it was Tuesday and raining.Improve your goldfish&#39;s physical fitness by getting him a bicycle.Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.My secretary is the only person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.He had concluded that pigs must be able to fly in Hog Heaven.The secret code they created made no sense, even to them.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.I used to live in my neighbor&#39;s fishpond, but the aesthetic wasn&#39;t to my taste.You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.I cheated while playing the darts tournament by using a longbow.Be careful with that butter knife.I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.He was 100% into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.Poison ivy grew through the fence they said was impenetrable.He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.All you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.The anaconda was the greatest criminal mastermind in this part of the neighborhood.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.The light in his life was actually a fire burning all around him.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains life well.The father died during childbirth.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.Peanut butter and jelly caused the elderly lady to think about her past.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Shruti; color: #4863A0;">She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.He found his art never progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.It&#39;s difficult to understand the lengths he&#39;d go to remain short.David proudly graduated from high school top of his class at age 97.The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.We have young kids who often walk into our room at night for various reasons including clowns in the closet.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things all the worse.I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve written over fifty novelsThe wake behind the boat told of the past while the open sea for told life in the unknown future.It&#39;s never comforting to know that your fate depends on something as unpredictable as the popping of corn.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.I am counting my calories, yet I really want dessert.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in order to be with her.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.Too many prisons have become early coffins.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.The fox in the tophat whispered into the ear of the rabbit.The secret code they created made no sense, even to them.When money was tight, he&#39;d get his lunch money from the local wishing well.Nancy decided to make the porta-potty her home.She was the type of girl that always burnt sugar to show she cared.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.He wasn&#39;t bitter that she had moved on but from the radish.She folded her handkerchief neatly.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.Joyce enjoyed eating pancakes with ketchup.</b></p>
