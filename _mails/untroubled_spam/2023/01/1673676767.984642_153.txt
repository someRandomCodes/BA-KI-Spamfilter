Hey

Today, my good friend, Cody Bramlett, is doing something special for people on my email list - and you’re one of those people!
http://www.unlockyourself.rest/11005-173-5176-33995/bruce/tindex9.html
You see, Cody believes in celebrating wins and he just found out this is a record breaking year for his supplement company.

And as a way to celebrate, he wants to give my email subscribers his special “Turmeric Refill” pricing that he only gives to people on his monthly subscription plan.

But today, he’s giving you the opportunity to get his refill pricing of Turmeric without signing up for our monthly subscription.
http://www.unlockyourself.rest/11005-173-5176-33995/bruce/tindex10.html
That means there are no strings attached.

Why is he doing this?

I asked him the same question and he said:

“If your loyal email subscribers like my turmeric with bioperine supplement as much as I know they will, then perhaps they’ll come back to us in the future and we’ll have another loyal customer for life!”

And don’t worry…

You won’t be charged again next month, next year, or ever again.

He’s simply giving you his “refill” pricing as a way to introduce himself.

But this special ends today or until they run out of bottles (whichever comes first).

>>Take advantage of Cody’s “Turmeric Refill” special until tonight.
William

The President of Italy is elected by an electoral college consisting of both chambers of Parliament sitting in joint session with 58 electors from the country's 20 regions. In the first three rounds of voting, a candidate must get two-thirds of the votes to win, but from the fourth round onwards only an absolute majority is needed. Reforms to the Constitution need to achieve a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes both in the Chamber and in the Senate to avoid the possibility of being sent to popular vote in order to be confirmed through a referendum. Japan Amendments to the constitution require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the National Diet and a simple majority in a referendum.[23] New Zealand Section 268 of the Electoral Act sets out a number of 'reserved provisions'. These provisions include section 17(1) of the Constitution Act 1986 (regarding Parliament's term length), section 35 of the Electoral Act (regarding the drawing of electoral boundaries), and section 74 of the Electoral Act (designating 18 as the minimum voting age). For a 'reserved provision' to be amended or repealed, a three-quarters majority is required in the House of Representatives or a majority is needed in a national referendu
