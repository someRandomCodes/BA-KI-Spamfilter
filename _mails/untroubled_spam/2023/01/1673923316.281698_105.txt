Og to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young&#39;s material earmarked for the box. Ultimately, nine tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were ed to CSNY. Intended for inclusion, the 1976 CSNY version of &quot;Human Highway&quot; was leaked to the internet several years later before receiving an official release on the Neil Young Archives Volume II: 1972&ndash;1976 box set in 2020. In 1994, CSN collaborated with Suzy Bogguss, Alison Krauss, and Kathy Mattea to contribute &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. By the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, Looking Forward. The album was released at Young&#39;s behest[citation needed] via Reprise Records in October 1999. With writing s mostly limited to band s, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at No. 26 (the group&#39;s highest chart placement since American Dream) during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, Looking Forward was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major -makers. CSN were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its s inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by actor and comedian Phil Hartman during his first career as a graphic designer. Various compilations of the band&#39;s configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and So Far being the most commercially ful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby&#39;s Voyage chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash&#39;s Reflections appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, Carry On, was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash. One of the backdrops during the 2006 &quot;dom of Speech&quot; tour, as shown , was the photos of American soldiers who h died in the war in Iraq. </span><br />
