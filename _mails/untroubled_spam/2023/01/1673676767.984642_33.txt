Dear Sir or Madam,

How do you control the standards and report the non-conformities of proce=
sses within the company?

We offer an application which enables our Customers to conduct qualitativ=
e, process and safety audits efficiently and gives the possibility of pre=
paring a plan and also controlling its implementation. In the event of de=
tecting any non-conformities, the system facilitates undertaking rapid re=
medial actions, which are also documented in the system.

By switching from paper sheets to the computer system, the solution sends=
 information about non-conformities automatically and immediately.

We also have many years=E2=80=99 experience in international projects, wo=
rking with various technologies and constantly adapting our products to c=
urrent trends.

Could I elaborate further on the scope of our activity and the functional=
ities of the application which may be used in your company?


Yours faithfully,
Victor Pollard
