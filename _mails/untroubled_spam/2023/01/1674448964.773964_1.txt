<p><b style="font: 8px IrisUPC; color: #736F6E;">She couldn&#39;t decide of the glass was half empty or half full so she drank it.The two walked down the slot canyon oblivious to the sound of thunder in the distance.He was sure the Devil created red sparkly glitter.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.The dead trees waited to be ignited by the smallest spark and seek their revenge.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.8 of 25 is the same as 25 of 8 and one of them is much easier to do in your head.The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.She finally understood that grief was her love with no place for it to go.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.The reservoir water level continued to lower while we enjoyed our long shower.He went back to the video to see what had been recorded and was shocked at what he saw.Kevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.He always wore his sunglasses at night.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.The doll spun around in circles in hopes of coming alive.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.She looked at the masterpiece hanging in the museum but she could think is that her five-year-old could do better.Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.The ice-cream trucks bring back bad memories for of us.Douglas figured best way to succeed was to do the opposite of what he&#39;d been doing his .It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but she could make herself happy.She discovered van is difficult with 2 cats and a dog.He&#39;s in a boy band which doesn&#39;t make much sense for a snake.they could see was the blue water surrounding their sailboat.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.</b></p>
