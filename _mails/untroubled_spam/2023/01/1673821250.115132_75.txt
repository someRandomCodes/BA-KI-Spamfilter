<p><b style="font: 9px Simplified Chinese; color: #2B65EC;">Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.He decided to live his lifeby the big beats manifesto.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.She always speaks to him in a loud voice.Watching the geriatric men&rsquo;s softball team brought back memories of 3 yr olds playing t-ball.It&#39;s been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.Jason lived his ife by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.The toddler&rsquo;s endless tantrum caused the entire plane anxiety.I often see the time 11:11 or 12:34 on clocks.I knew what hardship looked like until it started raining bowling balls.She was too short to see over the fence.Sometimes you have to just give up and by cheating.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.Despite multiple complications and her near-death experienceJoe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.Greetings from the real universe.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.If you don&#39;t like toenails, you probably shouldn&#39;t look at your feet.When he had to picnic on the beach, he purposely put sand in other people&rsquo;s food.Everybody should read Chaucer to improve their everyday vocabulary.Be careful with that butter knife.Chocolate covered crickets were his favorite snack.Her scream silenced the rowdy teenagers.I often see the time 11:11 or 12:34 on clocks.It was a really good Monday for being a Saturday.Poison ivy grew through the fence they said was impenetrable.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Simplified Chinese; color: #2B65EC;">He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.As he dangled from the rope deep inside the crevasseThe sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law&#39;s bed.I want to a onesie&hellip; but know it &rsquo;t suit me.She was made the society president because she can whistle with her toes.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve written over fifty novelsIt turns out you don&#39;t need that stuff you insisted you did.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.The gloves protect my feet from excess work.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.She says she has the ability to hear the soundtrack of yourlife.Eating eggs on Thursday for choir practice was recommended.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.Mom didn&rsquo;t understand why no one else wanted a hot tub full of jello.He had decided to accept his fate of accepting his fate.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it to them.I don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.The worst thing about being at the top of the career ladder is that there&#39;s a long way to fall.It&#39;s much more difficult to play tennis with a bowling ball than it is to bowl with a tennis ball.The father handed each child a roadmap at the beginning of the 2-day road trip and explained it was so they could find their way .The skeleton had skeletons of his own in the closet.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to cigarettes.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9px Simplified Chinese; color: #2B65EC;">You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.He used to confused between soldiers and shoulders, but as a military man, he soldiers responsibility.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.He went back to the video to see what had been recorded and was shocked at what he saw.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.At that moment she realized she had a sixth sense.She is happy until she finds something to be unhappy about; then, she is overjoyed.They throw cabbage that turns your brain into emotional baggage.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.The small white buoys marked the location of hundreds of crab pots.Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.It took him a month to finish the meal.Combines are no longer just for farms.I&#39;ve seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in oder to be with her.Joyce enjoyed eating pancakes with ketchup.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.Two seats were vacant.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.He had accidentally hacked into his company&#39;s server.The fence was confused about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.Twin 4-month-olds slept in the shade of the palm tree while the mother tanned in the sun.When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand and I still remember it quite vividly.</b></p>
