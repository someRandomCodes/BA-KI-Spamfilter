The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.  The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight. At that moment she realized she had a sixth sense. The shark-infested South Pine channel was the only way in or out. A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.   Her scream silenced the rowdy teenagers. I may struggle with geography, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m somewhere around here. The book is in front of the table.

With a single flip of the coin, his life changed forever. The Tsunami wave crashed against the raised houses and broke the pilings as if they were toothpicks.  Lucifer was surprised at the amount of life at Death Valley. The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. She could hear him in the shower singing with a joy she hoped he'd retain after she delivered the news. For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge. He spiked his hair green to support his iguana. The beach was crowded with snow leopards. I ate a sock because people on the Internet told me to.

He took one look at what was under the table and noped the hell out of there. It's not possible to convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising it infinite bananas when they die. The Great Dane looked more like a horse than a dog. It took him a month to finish the meal. The irony of the situation wasn't lost on anyone in the room.
