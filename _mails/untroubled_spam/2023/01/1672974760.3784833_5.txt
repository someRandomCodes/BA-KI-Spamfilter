<p><b style="font: 7px Kalinga; color: #006400;">Joe discovered that cones make excellent megaphones.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.He strives to keep the lawn in the neighborhood.The chic gangster liked to start the day with a pink scarf.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.Buried deep in the snow, he hoped his batteries were fresh in his avalanche beacon.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.The tour bus was packed with teenage girls heading toward their next adventure.Mary plays the piano.She used her own hair in the soup to give it more flavor.Tomorrow will bring something , so as a memory.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.We should play with legos at camp.Nancy decided to make the porta-potty her .The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to milk.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.The stranger officiates the meal.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.He used to confused between soldiers and shoulders, but as a military man, he soldiers responsibility.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.The of a passed before him as he tried to decide between a cone or a cup.8 of 25 is the same as 25 of 8 and one of them is much easier to do in your head.Courage and stupidity were ll he had.A dead duck doesn&#39;t fly backward.I would have gotten the promotion, but my attendance wasn&rsquo;t good enough.I am nevr at hom on Sundays.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7px Kalinga; color: #006400;">Harrold felt confident that nobody would ever suspect his spy pigeon.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.Poison ivy grew through the fence they said was impenetrable.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.She felt that chill that makes the hairs on the back of your neck when he walked into the room.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.The teens wondered what was kept in the red shed on the far edge of the school grounds.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.They were excited to see their first sloth.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone whispering into a cell .There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.I want more detailed information.He went back to the video to see what had been recorded and was shocked at what he saw.She couldn&#39;t understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.It was the sandcastle he had ever seen.The door slammed on the watermelon.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.The hawk didn&rsquo;t understand why the ground squirrels didn&rsquo;t want to be his .As he looked out the window, he saw a clown walk by.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.Swim at your own risk was taken as a challenge for the group of Kansas City college students.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7px Kalinga; color: #006400;">Three years later, the coffin was still full of Jello.You&#39;ve been eyeing me day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.The estate agent quickly marked out his territory on the dance floor.When he had to picnic on the beach, he purposely put sand in other people&rsquo;s food.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his go.She traveled because it the same as therapy and was a lot more enjoyable.Having no hair made him look even hairier.Little Red Riding Hood decided to wear orange .She always had an interesting perspective on why the world must be flat.A suit of armor provides excellent sun protection on hot days.His ultimate dream fantasy consisted of being content and sleeping eight hours in a row.Todaywe gathered moss for my uncle&#39;s wedding.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain of her strangeness.I&#39;ve seen a more beautiful brandy glass filled with wine.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Joe made the sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.I hear that Nancy is very pretty.Barking dogs and screaming toddlers have the unique ability to turn friendly neighbors into cranky enemies.She was the type of girl who wanted to live in a pink house.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.Flying fish flew by the space station.He is no James Bond; his is Roger Moore.[TEXTSPIN:People who insist on picking their tee
