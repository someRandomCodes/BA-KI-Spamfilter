						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What is a vehicle tracker?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quite simply, it&rsquo;s a small electronic box that fits inside your vehicle, which sends signals with details of where it is and what speed it is travelling at.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This super useful data comes from the GPS Satellite system, which also feeds position data on your vehicles to all your satnavs and devices.</span></p>





						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>In a word? Data. </i>These <a href="http://www.seemheight.shop/rwvwoq/jqxmi3727xvnqtepc/zmIznnfVqC9LvDhPQZo85pC5I_pO94Tc7wGeBr6YFt0/zSWq8Ck71tynuSZg9BzAh7XgpqDOsdt6ran2TP9JXERP2jL4QNvQjP-VPHO3vg1M2P-zYcRz1WS0SPzse8QwIA">modern tracking systems</a> give you and your company huge amounts of powerful data that will let you run your fleet more efficiently &ndash; which means <i>saving a lot of money</i>.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Most importantly, you can also <a href="http://www.seemheight.shop/rwvwoq/jqxmi3727xvnqtepc/zmIznnfVqC9LvDhPQZo85pC5I_pO94Tc7wGeBr6YFt0/zSWq8Ck71tynuSZg9BzAh7XgpqDOsdt6ran2TP9JXERP2jL4QNvQjP-VPHO3vg1M2P-zYcRz1WS0SPzse8QwIA">monitor driver behaviour data</a>, such as harsh acceleration and braking, time using the cruise control, pedal position, rpm bands, fuel consumption, and engine diagnostics. This nifty little device will stop your workers driving like maniacs in a flash!</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">And all of this rich telematics information is then fed back to you, directly on your PC or smart phone.</span></p>
