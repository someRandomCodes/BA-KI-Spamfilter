Shinto is polytheistic, involving the veneration of many deities known as kami,[60] or sometimes as jingi.[61] In Japanese, no distinction is made here between singular and plural, and hence the term kami refers both to individual kami and the collective group of kami.[62] Although lacking a direct English translation,[63] the term kami has sometimes been rendered as "god" or "spirit".[64] The historian of religion Joseph Kitagawa deemed these English translations "quite unsatisfactory and misleading",[65] and various scholars urge against translating kami into English.[66] In Japanese, it is often said that there are eight million kami, a term which connotes an infinite number,[67] and Shinto practitioners believe that they are present everywhere.[4] They are not regarded as omnipotent, omniscient, or necessarily immortal.[68] The term kami is "conceptually fluid",[69] being "vague and imprecise".[70] In Japanese it is often applied to the power of phenomena that inspire a sense of wonder and awe in the beholder.[71] Kitagawa referred to this as "the kami nature", stating that he thought it "somewhat analogous" to the Western ideas of the numinous and the sacred.[65] Kami are seen to inhabit both the living and the dead, organic and inorganic matter, and natural disasters like earthquakes, droughts, and plagues;[3] their presence is seen in natural forces such as the wind, rain, fire, and sunshine.[72] Accordingly, Nelson commented that Shinto regards "the actual phenomena of the world itself" as being "divine".[73] This perspective has been characterised as being animistic.[74] In Japan, kami have been venerated since prehistory.[4] During the Yayoi period they were regarded as being formless and invisible,[75] later coming to be depicted anthropomorphically under Buddhist influence.[76] Now, statues of the kami are known as shinzo.[77] Kami are usually associated with a specific place, often a prominent landscape feature such as a waterfall, mountain, large rock, or distinctive tree.[78] Physical objects or places in which the kami are believed to have a presence are termed shintai;[79] objects inhabited by the kami that are placed in the shrine are known as go-shintai.[80] Objects commonly chosen for this purpose include mirrors, swords, stones, beads, and inscribed tablets.[81] These go-shintai are concealed from the view of visitors,[82] and may be hidden inside boxes so that even the priests do not know what they look like.[79] Kami are deemed capable of both benevolent and destructive
