<p><b style="font: 5px New Century Schoolbook; color: #659EC7;">His confidence would have bee admirable if it wasn&#39;t for his stupidity.Homesickness became contagious in the young campers&#39; cabin.Nancy was proud that she ran a tight shipwreck.Bill ran from the giraffe toward the dolphin.She let the balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.When he encountered maize for the first time, he thought it incredibly corny.Red is greener than purple, for sure.You&#39;ll see the rainbow bridge after it rains cats and dogs.He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like what he saw.When he asked her favorite number, she answered without hesitation that it was diamonds.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.Some bathing suits just shouldn&rsquo;t be worn by some people.The view from the lighthouse excited even the most seasoned traveler.waiting for exceptional things to just happen.Two more days and his problems would be solved.Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.They looked up at the sky and saw a millin stars.Giving directions that the mountains are to the west works when you can see them.He figured a few sticks of dynamite were easier than a fishing pole to catch fish.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated.Karen realized the way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.He is no James Bond; his is Roger Moore.He learned the important lesson that a picnic at the beach on a windy day is a bad idea.My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.Dan took the deep dive down the rabbit hole.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px New Century Schoolbook; color: #659EC7;">The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.He created a pig burger out of beef.Gary didn&#39;t understand why Doug went upstairs to one dollar bills when he invited him to go cow tipping.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.Patricia found the meaning of in a bowl of Cheerios.They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the lady&rsquo;s bag of food.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.The secret ingredient to his was crime.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.Eating eggs on Thursday for choir practice was recommended.Three generations with six decades of experience.I purchased a baby clown from the Russian terrorist black market.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.He always wore his sunglasses at night.Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.A purple pig and a green donkey flew a kite in the middle of the night and ended up sunburnt.I&#39;ve traveled around Africa and still haven&#39;t found the gnu who stole my scarf.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.Green should have smelled more tranquil, but somehow it just tasted rotten.He was so preoccupied with whether or not he could that he failed to to consider if he should.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.The Japanese yen for commerce is still well-known.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px New Century Schoolbook; color: #659EC7;">She could hear him in the shower singing with a joy she hoped he&#39;d retain after she delivered the news.She opened up her third bottle of wine of the night.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.He hated that he loved what she hated about hate.We need to rent a room for our party.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide the way to the deepest depths.They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy.The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.I used to practice weaving with spaghetti three hours a day but stopped because I didn&#39;t want to die alone.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.You&#39;re unsure whether or not to trust him, but very thankful that you wore a turtle neck.My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.The toy brought back fond memories of being lost in the rain forest.The pet shop stocks everything you need to keep your anaconda happy.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.Weather is not trivial - it&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re standing in it.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things the worse.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.Don&#39;t put peanut butter on the dog&#39;s nose.Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition.It was at that moment that he learned there are certain parts of the body that you should Nair.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px New Century Schoolbook; color: #659EC7;">He liked to play with words in the bathtub.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.It was her first experience training a rainbow unicorn.Gwen had her best sleep ever on her bed of nails.More RVs were seen in the storage lot than at the campground.The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.He watched the dancing piglets with panda bear tummies in the swimming pool.Peanut butter and jelly caused the elderly lady to think about her past.She let the balloon float up into the air with her hopes and dreams.Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.They looked up at the sky and saw a millin stars.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.Kevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.Everyone was curious about the large white blimp that appeared overnight.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.I checked to make sure that he was still alive.He waited for the sign to turn to a go sign.The white water rafting trip was suddenly halted by the unexpected brick wall.It was a really good Monday for being a Saturday.Even with the snow falling outside, she felt it appropriate to wear her bikini.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.Jeanne wished she has chosen the red button.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of minerals.They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the lady&rsquo;s bag of food.The wake behind the boat told of the past while the sea for told in the unknown future.He learned the hardest lesson of his lif and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.The door swung to reveal pink giraffes and red elephants.</b></p>
