<p><b style="font: 8.5px Segoe UI; color: #ff0000;">There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.The elderly neighborhood became enraged over the coyotes who had been blamed for the poodle&rsquo;s disappearance.He decided to count all the sand on the beach as a hobby.The bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny&#39;s head by mere millimeters.He learned the hardest lesson of his life and had the scars, both physical and mental, to prove it.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.They wandered into a strange Tiki bar on the edge of the small beach town.I&#39;m confused: when people ask me what&#39;s up, and I point, they groan.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is only a matter of time.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.He appeared to be confusingly perplexed.There&#39;s probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium.I want more detailed information.The book is in front of the table.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.Mary plays the piano.We should play with legos at camp.The best part of marriage is animal crackers with peanut butter.Little Red Riding Hood decided to wear orange today.The team members were hard to tell apart since they all wore their hair in a ponytail.The tart lemonade quenched her thirst, but not her longing.He waited for the stop sign to turn to a go sign.The fence was confused about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out.He ended up burning his fingers poking someone else&#39;s fire.The wake behind the boat told of the past while the open sea for told life in the unknown future.I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me.Her life in the confines of the house became her new normal.His son quipped that power bars were nothing more than adult candy bars.It was the scarcity that fueled his creativity.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8.5px Segoe UI; color: #ff0000;">I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me.He dreamed of leaving his law firm to open a portable dog wash.Nothing seemed out of place except the washing machine in the bar.Hang on, my kittens are scratching at the bathtub and they&#39;ll upset by the lack of biscuits.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.Wisdom is easily acquired when hiding under the bed with a saucepan on your head.Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.The stranger officiates the meal.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.This is the last random sentence I will be writing and I am going to stop mid-sentIt must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.There were a lot of paintings of monkeys waving bamboo sticks in the gallery.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.Courage and stupidity were all he had.They decided to plant an orchard of cotton candy.The external scars tell only part of the story.Cursive writing is the best way to build a race track.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.Behind the window was a reflection that only instilled fear.My uncle&#39;s favorite pastime was building cars out of noodles.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.Today we gathered moss for my uncle&#39;s wedding.She saw no irony asking me to change but wanting me to accept her for who she is.She did her best to help him.Karen realized the only way she was getting into heaven was to cheat.The sign said there was road work ahead so he decided to speed up.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.The bread dough reminded her of Santa Clause&rsquo;s belly.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8.5px Segoe UI; color: #ff0000;">Flesh-colored yoga pants were far worse than even he feared.Today arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.Jason lived his life by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.</b></p>
