<p><b style="font: 5px Aharoni Bold; color: #0041C2;">The Dane looked more like a horse than a dog.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.Seek , but always be prepared for random cats.I hear that Nancy is very pretty.The tortoise jumped into the lake with dreams of becoming a sea turtle.Lets be unique together until we realize we are the same.She used her own hair in the soup to give it more flavor.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.That is an appealing treasure map that I can&#39;t read.I want to a onesie&hellip; but know it &rsquo;t suit me.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.Shakespeare was a famous 17th-century diesel mechanic.Eating eggs on Thursday for choir practice was recommended.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.There&#39;s a growing trend among teenagers of using frisbees as go-cart wheels.People who insist on picking their teeth with their elbows are so annoying!The child&rsquo;s favorite Christmas gift was the large box her father&rsquo;s lawnmower came in.Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good environment for learning English.I enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.The part of marriage is animal crackers with peanut butter.Just go ahead and press that button.Chocolate covered crickets were his favorite snack.It was a really good Monday for being a Saturday.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Malls are places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.The book is in front of the table.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.</b></p><br />

<p><b style="font: 5px Aharoni Bold; color: #0041C2;">I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realLucifer was surprised at the amount of at Death Valley.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.The clouds formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to wreak havoc.The knives were out and she was sharpening hers.For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.He went on a whiskey and lost three days.He colored deep space a soft yellow.I just wanted to tell you I could see the love you have for your child by the way you look at her.You&#39;ve been eyeing me day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.The small white buoys marked the location of hundreds of crab pots.Sarah ran from the serial killer holding a jug of milk.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.Nobody loves a pig wearing lipstick.waiting for exceptional things to just happen.If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsquo;ll stay away from it.While her friends were positive that Mary had a sixth sense, she knew she actually had a seventh sense.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.She learned that water bottles are no longer just to hold liquid, but they&#39;re also status symbols.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.I may struggle with geography, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m somewhere around .They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the lady&rsquo;s bag of food.Mr. Montoya knows the way to the bakery even though he&#39;s been there.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Aharoni Bold; color: #0041C2;">It&#39;s comforting to know that your fate depends on something as unpredictable as the popping of corn.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.Yeah, I think it&#39;s a good environment for learning English.She did not cheat on the test, for it was not the right thing to do.The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.Todaywe gathered moss for my uncle&#39;s wedding.If you spin around three times, you&#39;ll start to feel melancholy.He was sure the Devil created red sparkly glitter.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.The tour bus was packed with teenage girls heading toward their next adventure.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.Just go ahead and press that button.The key lime pie is still up for debate.Sometimes, you need to do is completely make an ass of yourself and laugh it to realise that isn&rsquo;t so bad after .Despite what your teacher may have told you, there is a wrong way to wield a lasso.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.I&#39;m a listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and that, but I hate people.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.The bird had a belief that it was really a groundhog.People who insist on picking their teeth with their elbows are so annoying!The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.The reservoir water level continued to lower while we enjoyed our long shower.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.The family&rsquo;s excitement over going to Disneyland was crazier than she anticipated.The water flowing down the river didn&rsquo;t look that powerful from the carPoison ivy grew through the fence they said was impenetrable.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.</b></p>
