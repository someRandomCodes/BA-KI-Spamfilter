<p><b style="font: 6px Calibri; color: #34282C;">Trash covered the landscape like sprinkles do a birthday cake.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.He ran out of , so he had to playing poker.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.He decided to count al the sand on the beach as a hobby.It doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list.Acres of almond trees lined the interstate highway which complimented the crazy driving nuts.It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight.The small white buoys marked the location of hundreds of crab pots.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one knew how to play bongos.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of , Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.A glittering gem is not enough.The rusty nail stood erect, angled at a 45-degree angle, just waiting for the barefoot to come along.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one knew how to play bongos.This book is sure to liquefy your brain.The llama couldn&#39;t resist trying the lemonade.The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.I want a giraffe, but I&#39;m a turtle eating waffles.The tumbleweed refused to tumble but was more than willing to prance.I made myself a peanut butter sandwich as I didn&#39;t want to subsist on veggie crackers.That must be the tenth time I&#39;ve been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.Let me help you with your baggage.When motorists sped in and out of , she could think of was those in need of a transplant.I need to ponder my existence and ask myself if I&#39;m truly realHe had a stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.</b></p>
