<p><b style="font: 9.5px Rockwell; color: #565051;">He dreamed of eating green apples with worms.Everyone says they love nature until they realize how dangerous she can be.All she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.I&#39;m a great listener, really good with empathy vs sympathy and all that, but I hate people.Never underestimate the willingness of the greedy to throw you under the bus.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.Jeanne wished she has chosen the red button.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.She was amazed by the large chunks of ice washing up on the beach.When he asked her favorite number, she answered without hesitation that it was diamonds.Nobody loves a pig wearing lipstick.Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.I would have gotten the promotion, but my attendance wasn&rsquo;t good enough.There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.It turns out you don&#39;t need all that stuff you insisted you did.She saw no irony asking me to change but wanting me to accept her for who she is.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.The changing of down comforters to cotton bedspreads always meant the squirrels had returned.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.There&#39;s probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium.The lake is a long way from here.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his friend go.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.The minute she landed she understood the reason this was a fly-over state.Everyone was curious about the large white blimp that appeared overnight.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Rockwell; color: #565051;">She was sad to hear that fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat loss, and pesticides.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.Improve your goldfish&#39;s physical fitness by getting him a bicycle.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.She looked at the masterpiece hanging in the museum but all she could think is that her five-year-old could do better.It&#39;s always a good idea to seek shelter from the evil gaze of the sun.We will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along.Always bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition.There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have money to go to the store.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of all minerals.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.His son quipped that power bars were nothing more than adult candy bars.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.They ran around the corner to find that they had traveled back in time.Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.The clock within this blog and the clock on my laptop are 1 hour different from each other.He excelled at firing people nicely.All you need to do is pick up the pen and begin.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.I&#39;ve always wanted to go to Tajikistan, but my cat would miss me.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.He poured rocks in the dungeon of his mind.Jason lived his life by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.He ran out of money, so he had to stop playing poker.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 9.5px Rockwell; color: #565051;">A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.When he encountered maize for the first time, he thought it incredibly corny.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.The door slammed on the watermelon.I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve written over fifty novelsKevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.If you really strain your ears, you can just about hear the sound of no one giving a damn.Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.Check back tomorrow; I will see if the book has arrived.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.Nancy was proud that she ran a tight shipwreck.The white water rafting trip was suddenly halted by the unexpected brick wall.She moved forward only because she trusted that the ending she now was going through must be followed by a new beginning.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.She was sad to hear that fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat loss, and pesticides.The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.As he dangled from the rope deep inside the crevasseThe sight of his goatee made me want to run and hide under my sister-in-law&#39;s bed.Hit me with your pet shark!The light in his life was actually a fire burning all around him.Lightning Paradise was the local hangout joint where the group usually ended up spending the night.Too many prisons have become early coffins.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.Last Friday I saw a spotted striped blue worm shake hands with a legless lizard.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.</b></p>
