<p><b style="font: 6px AngsanaUPC; color: #565051;">She was sad to hear that fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat loss, and pesticides.The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.He realized there had been several deaths on this road, but his concern rose when he saw the exact number.She finally understood that grief was her love with no place for it to go.The external scars tell only part of the story.Nudist colonies shun fig-leaf couture.There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.He wondered why at 18 he was old enough to go to war, but not old enough to buy cigarettes.Hit me with your pet shark!It&#39;s not often you find a soggy banana on the street.For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.I love eating toasted cheese and tuna sandwiches.I was fishing for compliments and accidentally caught a trout.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.We will not allow you to bring your pet armadillo along.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide all the way to the deepest depths.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.She looked into the mirror and saw another person.Best friends are like old tomatoes and shoelaces.Various sea birds are elegant, but nothing is as elegant as a gliding pelican.There&#39;s probably enough glass in my cupboard to build an undersea aquarium.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his friend go.He was surprised that his immense laziness was inspirational to others.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.I may struggle with geography, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m somewhere around here.It had been sixteen days since the zombies first attacked.The snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the back-country.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 6px AngsanaUPC; color: #565051;">For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.She wanted to be rescued, but only if it was Tuesday and raining.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but today wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to get milk.The body piercing didn&#39;t go exactly as he expected.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.Lucifer was surprised at the amount of life at Death Valley.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.She wondered what his eyes were saying beneath his mirrored sunglasses.You bite up because of your lower jaw.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.Greetings from the real universe.Malls are great places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.Some bathing suits just shouldn&rsquo;t be worn by some people.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains life well.The fox in the tophat whispered into the ear of the rabbit.They say that dogs are man&#39;s best friend, but this cat was setting out to sabotage that theory.When money was tight, he&#39;d get his lunch money from the local wishing well.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 6px AngsanaUPC; color: #565051;">She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.He found his art never progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is only a matter of time.The efficiency we have at removing trash has made creating trash more acceptable.To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn&#39;t quite go as expected.He found a leprechaun in his walnut shell.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things all the worse.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this all about?I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.He had reached the point where he was paranoid about being paranoid.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing open my piggy bank on the same day!Sometimes you have to just give up and win by cheating.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.She advised him to come back at once.He hated that he loved what she hated about hate.His get rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.She was sad to hear that fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat loss, and pesticides.Charles ate the french fries knowing they would be his last meal.The beauty of the African sunset disguised the danger lurking nearby.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.When confronted with a rotary dial phone the teenager was perplexed.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.She folded her handkerchief neatly.I only enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.</b></p>
