The Australian Government placed its first orders for M113s during the 1963â€“1964 financial year. At this time, it was planned to retain the type until 1995. The Australian Army began operating M113s in March 1965, and they were successfully used in combat during the Vietnam War. Multiple orders for M113s were placed, totalling either 817 or 840. These comprised nine variants tailored for different roles, with the majority being M113A1 armoured personnel carriers. Deliveries were completed in 1979. From 1970 the M113 was the standard vehicle for all of the Army's armoured units other than the 1st Armoured Regiment, which operated tanks.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) was partially restructured in line with the Defence of Australia policy. This policy was focused on protecting continental Australia, and especially northern Australia, from attack and represented a move away from previous policies which had been based around expeditionary warfare. It also included an emphasis on self-reliance. However, force structure design was hampered by unclear strategic guidance and budget limitations. The Army began preparing for conventional warfare in Australia, but there was an institutional belief that an invasion was highly unlikely. The Liberal-Country party coalition Fraser government that was in power from 1975 to March 1983 and the Australian Labor Party Hawke government that succeeded it had similar defence policies during this period.

There were differences of opinion between the ADF and the civilian Department of Defence over the nature of the threats that should be used as a basis for force design. This arose from assessments that found that there was no imminent threat to the country's security. The d
