It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.Tom got a small piece of pie.The skeleton had skeletons of his own in the closet.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.There have been days when I wished to be separated from my body, but today wasn&rsquo;t one of those days.Patricia found the meaning of life in a bowl of Cheerios.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.They called out her name time and again, but were met with nothing but silence.I think I will buy the red car, or I will lease the blue one.We have a lot of rain in June.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?Pat ordered a ghost pepper pie.He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.For the 216th time, he said he would quit drinking soda after this last Coke.Nancy decided to make the porta-potty her home.The fog was so dense even a laser decided it wasn&#39;t worth the effort.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.You should never take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.It must be easy to commit crimes as a snake because you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving fingerprints.Pink horses galloped across the sea.Art doesn&#39;t have to be intentional.The small white buoys marked the location of hundreds of crab pots.Everyone was curious about the large white blimp that appeared overnight.Jason lived his life by the motto, &quot;Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 4px AlternateGothic2 BT; color: #2727dd;">As she walked along the street and looked in the gutter, she realized facemasks had become the new cigarette butts.They say people remember important moments in their life well, yet no one even remembers their own birth.The swirled lollipop had issues with the pop rock candy.The door slammed on the watermelon.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.If eating three-egg omelets causes weight-gain, budgie eggs are a good substitute.On each full moonWhenever he saw a red flag warning at the beach he grabbed his surfboard.He took one look at what was under the table and noped the hell out of there.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is only a matter of time.He felt that dining on the bridge brought romance to his relationship with his cat.He was 100% into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.You have no right to call yourself creative until you look at a trowel and think that it would make a great lockpick.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.A kangaroo is really just a rabbit on steroids.Please put on these earmuffs because I can&#39;t you hear.My secretary is the only person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.The delicious aroma from the kitchen was ruined by cigarette smoke.The ice-cream trucks bring back bad memories for all of us.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.There&#39;s a reason that roses have thorns.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.The fifty mannequin heads floating in the pool kind of freaked them out.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 4px AlternateGothic2 BT; color: #2727dd;">Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.Tomorrow will bring something new, so leave today as a memory.I come from a tribe of head-hunters, so I will never need a shrink.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to stop the sewage flowing from his mouth.We have a lot of rain in June.It would have been a better night if the guys next to us weren&#39;t in the splash zone.Just because the water is red doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t drink it.The ice-cream trucks bring back bad memories for all of us.I may struggle with geography, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m somewhere around here.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.I am never at home on Sundays.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.I love bacon, beer, birds, and baboons.He went back to the video to see what had been recorded and was shocked at what he saw.He had a wall full of masks so she could wear a different face every day.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.He played the game as if his life depended on it and the truth was that it did.The worst thing about being at the top of the career ladder is that there&#39;s a long way to fall.Jeanne wished she has chosen the red button.His get rich quick scheme was to grow a cactus farm.He spiked his hair green to support his iguana.If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.He never understood why what, when, and where left out who.If you like tuna and tomato sauce, try combining the two, it&rsquo;s really not as bad as it sounds.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain all of her strangeness.The bread dough reminded her of Santa Clause&rsquo;s belly.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.The clock within this blog and the clock on my laptop are 1 hour different from each other.</b></p>
