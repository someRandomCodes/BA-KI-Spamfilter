						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What is a vehicle tracker?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">Quite simply, it&rsquo;s a small electronic box that fits inside your vehicle, which sends signals with details of where it is and what speed it is travelling at.</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">This super useful data comes from the GPS Satellite system, which also feeds position data on your vehicles to all your satnavs and devices.</span></p>





						<h2><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></span></h2>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>In a word? Data. </i>These <a href="http://www.jetemphasis.shop/Lswugs/cdhdtjjp3057gllefaa/PEmtiSdyU-Sop_v0v-YQIbJLsvVkhmaAKBzqO0RQUWI/D6pNYWPlpA85x1f4hSSuutSlJ3c1Q9I_Nck0r25ewGUN8_nxVOsG7xw31ea2Q7SimxXqmjDyd80KbniCi9GdU2RG2ZY2rum4u_jKkrmD0Zw">modern tracking systems</a> give you and your company huge amounts of powerful data that will let you run your fleet more efficiently &ndash; which means <i>saving a lot of money</i>.</span></p>

This nifty little device will stop your workers driving like maniacs in a flash!</span></p>





						<p><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;">And all of this rich telematics information is then fed back to you, directly on your PC or smart phone.</span></p>
