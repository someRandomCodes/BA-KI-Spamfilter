Always in need of funds, Charles could not cancel the subventio generalis, although it was the most unpopular tax in the Regno. Instead he granted exemptions to individuals and communities, especially to the French and Provençal colonists, which increased the burden on those who did not enjoy such privileges. The yearly, or occasionally more frequent, obligatory exchange of the deniers—the coins almost exclusively used in local transactions—was also an important, and unpopular, source of revenue for the royal treasury. Charles took out forced loans whenever he needed "immediately a large sum of money for certain arduous and pressing business", as he explained in one of his decrees.

Purveyances, the requisitioning of goods, increased the unpopularity of Charles's government in southern Italy and Sicily. His subjects were also liable to be forced to guard prisoners or lodge soldiers in their homes. The restoration of old fortresses, bridges and aqueducts and the building of new castles required the employment of craftsmen, although most of them were unwilling to participate in such lengthy projects. Thousands of people were forced to serve in the army in foreign lands, especially after 1279. Trading in salt was declared a royal monopoly. In December 1281, Charles again ordered the collection of the subventio generalis, requiring the payment of 150% of the customary amount.

Charles did not pay attention to the island of Sicily, although it had been the centre of resistance against him in 1268. He transferred the capital from Palermo to Naples. He did not visit the island after 1271, preventing Sicilians from directly informing him of their grievances. Sicilian noblemen were seldom employed as royal officials, although he often appointed their southern It

<p style="font-size:28px;color:#FF0000;font-weight:bold;">I Reduced Signs of Dark Spots Under My Eye By Using This One Device (That I Keep In My Freezer?)</p>
</center>
To make things worse, I woke up one morning, looked at myself in the mirror, and... <a href="http://myhousez.shop/tLNYcRXoJzrPbhcWFUqfjGU2tDW_GUvEnSV_g_RCzgxUeUHh" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank">it looked like the dark circles under my eyes were twice as big as normal.</a><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>I checked the next day, and the next, and the next, but... they weren&rsquo;t going away.</strong><br />
<br />
I thought it was because I wasn&rsquo;t sleeping well. If I could get my life back together, the dark circles would go away.<br />
<br />
It was driving me crazy. With everything else spiraling out of control, I couldn&rsquo;t let my looks spiral out of control, too.<br />
<br />
