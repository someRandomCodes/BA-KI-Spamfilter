Planning for the M113 upgrade project began in the early 1990s.[2] As part of the development of a business case for the upgrade following 2000, consideration was given to replacing the M113s with IFVs such as the American M2 Bradley. It was decided to not procure IFVs at this time as they were considered too expensive and difficult to deploy by air.[62] The development work proved to be protracted, and the first upgraded M113s were accepted by the Australian Army in November 2007.[63] Deliveries were completed in September 2012.[64] All of the upgrade work was undertaken in Australia by the company Tenix.[65] Some of the metallurgical research undertaken as part of Project Waler was drawn on for the upgrades to the M113s' armour.[42] By the time the M113 upgrade project was complete, the vehicles were no longer suitable for combat. This was because they did not provide adequate protection against heavy machine guns, most forms of modern anti-tank missiles, mines and large improvised explosive devices. The shortcomings of the upgraded M113s left the Army with a significant capability gap that required a replacement project to be launched.[66] Subsequent IFV project Colour photo of a tracked military vehicle with a gun turret A Rheinmetall Lynx, one of the two IFV designs being considered to replace the M113s as of 2022[67] In 2018, tenders were sought for IFVs to replace the M113s.[68][69] The Australian Government initially planned to acquire up to 450 of these vehicles, with the majority being built in Australia.[70][71] The IFVs are expected to be much heavier, better armed and more strongly protected than the M113s.[72] The number of IFVs to be purchased was cut to 300 in mid-2022 to reduce the program's cost, which is expected to be the most expensive ever undertaken for the Army.[73] A decision on the type of IFV to be purchased was originally sche
