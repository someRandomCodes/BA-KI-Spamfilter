<p><b style="font: 5px Brush Script Std; color: #6D6968;">There should have been a time and a place, but this wasn&#39;t it.Normal activities took extraordinary amounts of concentration at the high altitude.Traveling became almost extinct during the pandemic.She had some news to share but nobody to share it with.I liked their first two albums but changed my mind after that charity gig.The truth is that you pay for your lifestyle in hours.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.Flash photography is best used in full sunlight.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.This book is sure to liquefy your brain.In that instnt, everything changed.The wake behind the boat told of the past while the sea for told in the unknown future.She can live her however she wants as long as she listens to what I have to say.The teenage boy was accused of breaking his arm simply to out of the test.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.He invested some skill points in Charisma and Strength.He was willing to find the depths of the rabbit hole in oder to be with her.I caught my squirrel rustling through my gym bag.Nobody loves a pig wearing lipstick.He had a stash underneath the floorboards in the back room of the house.Lets be unique together until we realize we are the same.There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.Someone I know recently combined Maple Syrup &amp; buttered Popcorn thinking it would taste like caramel popcorn. It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.Henry couldn&#39;t decide if he was an auto mechanic or a priest.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Brush Script Std; color: #6D6968;">Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.He watched the dancing piglets with panda bear tummies in the swimming pool.The teens wondered what was kept in the red shed on the far edge of the school grounds.He used to confused between soldiers and shoulders, but as a military man, he soldiers responsibility.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.Hit me with your pet shark!You should nver take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.I became paranoid that the school of jellyfish was spying on me.Purple is best city in the forest.He was surprised that his immense laziness was inspirational to others.Bill ran from the giraffe toward the dolphin.Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.I&#39;ve traveled around Africa and still haven&#39;t found the gnu who stole my scarf.It dawned on her that others could make her happier, but she could make herself happy.People keep telling me &quot;orange&quot; but I still prefer &quot;pink&quot;.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.The efficiency we have at removing trash has made creating trash more acceptable.I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.The miniature pet elephant became the envy of the neighborhood.I am nevr at hom on Sundays.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.I hear that Nancy is very pretty.He didn&#39;t heed the warning and it had turned out surprisingly well.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.The light in his was actually a fire burning around him.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.She moved forward nly because she trusted that the ending she no was going through must be followed by a ne beginning.He would survive if he kept the fire going and he could hear thunder in the distance.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 5px Brush Script Std; color: #6D6968;">Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to milk.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.The key lime pie is still up for debate.He found the chocolate covered roaches quite tasty.He wondered if she would appreciate his toenail collection.The secret code they created made no sense, even to them.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one knew how to play bongos.Iron pyrite is the most foolish of minerals.We have been to Asia, nor have we visited Africa.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.tell me you don&#39;t work in a morgue.The body piercing didn&#39;t go exactly as he expected.They looked up at the sky and saw a millin stars.Honestly, I didn&#39;t care much for the first season, so I didn&#39;t bother with the second.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.The balloons floated away along with my hopes and dreams.Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.As she walked along the street and looked in the gutter, she realized facemasks had become the cigarette butts.The balloons floated away along with my hopes and dreams.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.He liked to play with words in the bathtub.He excelled at firing people nicely.The balloons floated away along with my hopes and dreams.Thirty years later, she still thought it was okay to put the toilet paper roll under rather than over.Joe discovered that cones make excellent megaphones.Patricia loves the sound of nails strongly pressed against the chalkboard.I want to a onesie&hellip; but know it &rsquo;t suit me.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.He didn&#39;t understand why the bird wanted to ride the bicycle.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.</b></p>
