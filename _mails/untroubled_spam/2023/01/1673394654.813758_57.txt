<p><b style="font: 7px Cordia New; color: #837E7C;">They throw cabbage that turns your brain into emotional baggage.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw money, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer.You&#39;ve been eyeing me all day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.He spiked his hair green to support his iguana.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide all the way to the deepest depths.Greetings from the galaxy MACS0647-JD, or what we call home.She had a difficult time owning up to her own crazy self.As he entered the church he could hear the soft voice of someone whispering into a cell phone.He decided to count all the sand on the beach as a hobby.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is only a matter of time.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.He found the end of the rainbow and was surprised at what he found there.As the rental car rolled to a stop on the dark road, her fear increased by the moment.When nobody is around, the trees gossip about the people who have walked under them.The teenage boy was accused of breaking his arm simply to get out of the test.She discovered van life is difficult with 2 cats and a dog.I&#39;m worried by the fact that my daughter looks to the local carpet seller as a role model.It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.My secretary is the only person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.The most exciting eureka moment I&#39;ve had was when I realized that the instructions on food packets were just guidelines.I am my aunt&#39;s sister&#39;s daughter.The dead trees waited to be ignited by the smallest spark and seek their revenge.Truth in advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 7px Cordia New; color: #837E7C;">Being unacquainted with the chief raccoon was harming his prospects for promotion.Tomorrow will bring something new, so leave today as a memory.You have every right to be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to be mean.I don&rsquo;t respect anybody who can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke.Mothers spend months of their lives waiting on their children.Her daily goal was to improve on yesterday.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of gold, Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.He appeared to be confusingly perplexed.Your girlfriend bought your favorite cookie crisp cereal but forgot to get milk.The random sentence generator generated a random sentence about a random sentence.When she didn&rsquo;t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.As time wore on, simple dog commands turned into full paragraphs explaining why the dog couldn&rsquo;t do something.Peanuts don&#39;t grow on trees, but cashews do.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.She wanted to be rescued, but only if it was Tuesday and raining.his seven-layer cake only had six layers.The gruff old man sat in the back of the bait shop grumbling to himself as he scooped out a handful of worms.He spiked his hair green to support his iguana.If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.She advised him to come back at once.It was difficult for Mary to admit that most of her workout consisted of exercising poor judgment.He ended up burning his fingers poking someone else&#39;s fire.The bread dough reminded her of Santa Clause&rsquo;s belly.On a scale from one to ten, what&#39;s your favorite flavor of random grammar?Greetings from the galaxy MACS0647-JD, or what we call home.It must be five o&#39;clock somewhere.I trust everything that&#39;s written in purple ink.</b></p>
