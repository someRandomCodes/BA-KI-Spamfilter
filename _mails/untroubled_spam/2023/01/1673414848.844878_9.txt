<p><b style="font: 6px Sitka; color: #488AC7;">Italy is my favorite country; in fact, I plan to spend two weeks there next year.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.There are no heroes in a punk rock band.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.My secretary is the only person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.Garlic ice-cream was her favorite.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.We have young kids who often walk into our room at night for various reasons including clowns in the closet.If you like tuna and tomato sauce, try combining the two, it&rsquo;s really not as bad as it sounds.He was an introvert that extroverts seemed to love.Gary didn&#39;t understand why Doug went upstairs to get one dollar bills when he invited him to go cow tipping.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.A song can make or ruin a person&rsquo;s day if they let it get to them.For some unfathomable reason, the response team didn&#39;t consider a lack of milk for my cereal as a proper emergency.That must be the tenth time I&#39;ve been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars.You realize you&#39;re not alone as you sit in your bedroom massaging your calves after a long day of playing tug-of-war with Grandpa Joe in the hospital.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing open my piggy bank on the same day!Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.There were three sphered rocks congregating in a cubed room.The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.Plans for this weekend include turning wine into water.Jim liked driving around town with his hazard lights on.Don&#39;t step on the broken glass.Today I bought a raincoat and wore it on a sunny day.They desperately needed another drummer since the current one only knew how to play bongos.He ran out of money, so he had to stop playing poker.I caught my squirrel rustling through my gym bag.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 6px Sitka; color: #488AC7;">The best key lime pie is still up for debate.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is only a matter of time.She is never happy until she finds something to be unhappy about; then, she is overjoyed.Smoky the Bear secretly started the fires.The tears of a clown make my lipstick run, but my shower cap is still intact.There were a lot of paintings of monkeys waving bamboo sticks in the gallery.I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve written over fifty novelsKevin embraced his ability to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.You should never take advice from someone who thinks red paint dries quicker than blue paint.Tomatoes make great weapons when water balloons aren&rsquo;t available.Joe discovered that traffic cones make excellent megaphones.Check back tomorrow; I will see if the book has arrived.My dentist tells me that chewing bricks is very bad for your teeth.The furnace repairman indicated the heating system was acting as an air conditioner.Watching the geriatric men&rsquo;s softball team brought back memories of 3 yr olds playing t-ball.The lake is a long way from here.If any cop asks you where you were, just say you were visiting Kansas.My uncle&#39;s favorite pastime was building cars out of noodles.The secret code they created made no sense, even to them.He is good at eating pickles and telling women about his emotional problems.Please tell me you don&#39;t work in a morgue.Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding.When confronted with a rotary dial phone the teenager was perplexed.The sunblock was handed to the girl before practice, but the burned skin was proof she did not apply it.I always dreamed about being stranded on a desert island until it actually happened.I was starting to worry that my pet turtle could tell what I was thinking.She lived on Monkey Jungle Road and that seemed to explain all of her strangeness.The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.</b></p>
