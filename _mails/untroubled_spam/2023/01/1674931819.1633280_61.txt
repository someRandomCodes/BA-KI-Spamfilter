This is something you don’t see everyday...

This mad doctor infected a thousand women with oral and genital herpes then used a strange practice to cure every single one of them.

Although there is much controversy surrounding how these women gave their permission to be infected with the virus, the doctor claims it was all legal.

Tensions rose when the guy was taken to court, as a small number of people, apparently members of the Democratic party, assaulted the man.

“He will burn in hell for what he did”, yelled one lady at the reporters, before actually knowing the full story.

In fact, a court report shows that every single one of the test subjects was herpes free in 21 days.

The judges didn’t seem to like this guy, so they tried to sentence him to 2 years in federal prison.

But when 348 of the women he infected and then cured, showed up to testify on his behalf, the judges went full crazy.

They had no other choice but to set him free.

As revenge, he posted all his findings here, for a short time.

The news has definitely shocked the entire herpes community and will most likely plummet the profits of some of the biggest herpes drug manufacturers.

The mad doctor says that for as long as he can, he will keep his findings online.

But the court may rule against it very soon.

So hurry and grab them as you still can.

Best of luck to you!




















With the Wizards of the Coast relaunch in 1998 the contents, under editor Kim Mohan, became more media-focused. The initial plan was to have two or three stories per issue based on films, TV, and games.[54][102] The 600th issue, in early 2000, included a Harlan Ellison story, as well as a story from the 100th issue, the 200th issue, and so on, up to the 500th issue. Pamela Sargent also contributed a story.[103] The Paizo publishing relaunch, in 2004, was even more focused on media content than the Wizards of the Coast version had been, with much more movie and comics-related material than science fiction. Several well-known authors appeared in the first issue, including Harlan Ellison, Bruce Sterling, and Gene Wolfe. Paizo also ran a blog for the magazine.[104][105] The fiction received positive reviews,[106] but Paizo soon put the magazine on temporary hold, and canceled it permanently the following year.[56] The title remained in limbo until Steve Davidson's online version appeared in 2012.[59] Influence on the field Amazing Stories was influential simply by being the first of its kind. In the words of science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, the magazine was "a snag in the stream of history, from which a V-shape spread out in dozens and then in hundreds of altered lives".[107] Many early fans of the field began to communicate with each other through the letter column, and to publish fanzines—amateur fan publications that helped establish connections among fans across the country.

Influence on the field
Amazing Stories was influential simply by being the first of its kind. In the words of science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, the magazine was "a snag in the stream of history, from which a V-shape spread out in dozens and then in hundreds of altered lives".[107] Many early fans of the field began to communicate with each other through the letter column, and to publish fanzines—amateur fan publications that helped establish connections among fans across the country.
