<p><b style="font: 8px Book Antiqua; color: #4C4646;">She was sad to hear that fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat loss, and pesticides.Nancy was proud that she ran a tight shipwreck.I like to leave work after my eight-hour tea-break.Cats are good pets, for they are clean and are not noisy.As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.Garlic ice-cream was her favorite.He had concluded that pigs must be able to fly in Hog Heaven.He took one look at what was under the table and noped the hell out of there.If you like tuna and tomato sauce, try combining the two, it&rsquo;s really not as bad as it sounds.There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have money to go to the store.The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.People who insist on picking their teeth with their elbows are so annoying!Be careful with that butter knife.Acres of almond trees lined the interstate highway which complimented the crazy driving nuts.She had that tint of craziness in her soul that made her believe she could actually make a difference.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.Strawberries must be the one food that doesn&#39;t go well with this brand of paint.Malls are great places to shop; I can find everything I need under one roof.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.Patricia found the meaning of life in a bowl of Cheerios.It was obvious she was hot, sweaty, and tired.I only enjoy window shopping when the windows are transparent.Some bathing suits just shouldn&rsquo;t be worn by some people.Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.You&#39;ve been eyeing me all day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.The father died during childbirth.Her scream silenced the rowdy teenagers.When money was tight, he&#39;d get his lunch money from the local wishing well.</b></p>





<p><b style="font: 8px Book Antiqua; color: #4C4646;">As he waited for the shower to warm, he noticed that he could hear water change temperature.25 years later, she still regretted that specific moment.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.David proudly graduated from high school top of his class at age 97.It&#39;s never been my responsibility to glaze the donuts.We have young kids who often walk into our room at night for various reasons including clowns in the closet.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things all the worse.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.Sometimes I stare at a door or a wall and I wonder what is this reality, why am I alive, and what is this all about?It&#39;s important to remember to be aware of rampaging grizzly bears.She thought there&#39;d be sufficient time if she hid her watch.You have every right to be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to be mean.After fighting off the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.The memory we used to share is no longer coherent.Baby wipes are made of chocolate stardust.She advised him to come back at once.Hit me with your pet shark!Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.The fox in the tophat whispered into the ear of the rabbit.The golden retriever loved the fireworks each Fourth of July.When money was tight, he&#39;d get his lunch money from the local wishing well.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.Hit me with your pet shark!He was sure the Devil created red sparkly glitter.She was too short to see over the fence.Too many prisons have become early coffins.The paintbrush was angry at the color the artist chose to use.I liked their first two albums but changed my mind after that charity gig.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.</b></p>
