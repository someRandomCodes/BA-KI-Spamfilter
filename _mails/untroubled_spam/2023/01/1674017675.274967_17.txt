Aliens opened to generally positive reviews.[102] It appeared on the cover of the July 28, 1986, edition of Time magazine, which called it "The Summer's Scariest Movie".[116] Audience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.[117] Most reviewers agreed Aliens was a worthy successor to Alien.[118][119] Variety and Walter Goodman said it could not replicate the novelty of the first film, but Aliens compensated with special effects, technique, and a constant stream of set-piece thrills and scary scenes.[3][118] Variety added Aliens was made by an expert craftsman, suggesting its predecessor was a more artistic endeavor.[118] Sheila Benson said Aliens was clever and ironically funny, but lacked Alien's pure horror. Benson attributed this to an overabundance of creature effects in the intervening years, particularly the 1982 science-fiction horror film The Thing (which, Benson said, took alien monstrosities to an extreme).[120] According to Rick Kogan, Aliens demonstrated that science-fiction horror could still be entertaining after many poorly received Alien-derived films.[121] Dave Kehr and Richard Schickel called it a rare sequel which surpassed the original, and Kehr appreciated the action used to develop the characters. Schickel wrote that the film had evolved from Alien, giving Weaver new emotional depths.[119][122] Jay Scott said Cameron had redefined the war film, combining Rambo with Star Wars.[123] Kogan agreed Cameron possessed a knack for action pacing and excitement, but Kehr believed Cameron pushed some elements beyond believability.[121][122] Roger Ebert called the last hour "painfully, unremittingly intense" in horror and action, leaving him emotionally drained and unhappy. Ebert believed it could not be defined as entertainment, despite his adm
