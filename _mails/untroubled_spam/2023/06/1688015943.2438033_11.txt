By the end of the 1920s, he became a member of the Communist Party of Argentina. In 1933 he joined the first Argentine artists' guild, and later that year he exhibited at the National Fine Arts Hall in Buenos Aires. His work, predominantly realist in his earlier years, became more figurative, later on, and though his Communist affiliation was reflected in numerous works with social undertones, he painted a wide variety of subject matter.

Along with Antonio Berni, Spilimbergo and Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, he created a series of murals for a villa belonging to local businessman Natalio Botana, in Don Torcuato. Castagnino traveled to Paris in 1939, where he attended the atelier of cubist painter André Lhote, later traveling across Europe perfecting his art and in the company of Georges Braque, Fernand Léger and Pablo Picasso, among others. Castagnino returned to Argentina in 1941, where he enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires and obtained a degree in architecture. He received numerous awards in subsequent years, including the Grand Prize of Honor of the Argentine National Hall (1961), the Medal of Honor at Expo '58 (Brussels, 1958), and a special mention for his drawings at the II Mexico City Biennale of 1962.

Pop quiz:<br />
<br />
Do you know what the greatest power on Earth is?<br />
<br />
Hold on.<br />
<br />
Because most people actually get this wrong - and I have a sneaking suspicion you will too.<br />
<br />
(Don&rsquo;t feel bad if you do, you&rsquo;re in good company ;-)<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m going to tell you what it is (so you can see if you&rsquo;re guess is right) but first -<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ll give you a hint and tell you three things it&rsquo;s not:<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s not Money<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s not Energy<br />
<br />

<br />
Okay, so what the heck IS it???<br />

<br />
You&rsquo;ll be very glad you learned this little fact today (when you realize what you can do with this power once you have it in your possession).<br />
<br />
Please promise only to use it for good though - so I don&rsquo;t regret <a href="http://sonavels.today/-pLr3QMW9uDSLIMPUf0-iskrMUqWWjTpdSNWkcTrBQjIXfBe" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank"><b>showing you this ;-) </b></a><br />
