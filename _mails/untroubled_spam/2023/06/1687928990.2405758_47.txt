ersfield won the Fourth Division in 1979–80, scoring 101 goals in the process. Town finished just outside the promotion places the following season. The team won promotion to the Second Division in 1982–83 by a third-place finish. Due to Huddersfield languishing at the bottom of the division, declining home attendances, and the resulting financial pressure, Buxton was sacked in December 1986. Steve Smith succeeded him, and became the first (and as of 2023, only) permanent manager in the club's history to hail from Huddersfield. The team stayed up by three points that season, but were relegated back to the third tier in 1987–88. Town only won six matches, conceded 100 goals, and lost 10–1 against Manchester City. Huddersfield reached the 1991–92 Third Division play-offs, but lost the semi-final against Peterborough United by an aggregate score of 4–3.

During the first season at the new stadium, Huddersfield were promoted to the second tier via the play-offs after a 2–1 win against Bristol Rovers at Wembley.
