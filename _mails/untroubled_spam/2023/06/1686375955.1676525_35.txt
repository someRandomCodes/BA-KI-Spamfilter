Dear bruce@untroubled.org,
I have sent you  this email  from Goma, Democratic Republic of=20
Congo.

I am writing to inquire if your company can supply food (rice)
to a war region.
We do not have cash money for payment, but we have raw gold for.=20
exchange.

We shall convey our gold to you first before your supply.

Please note that your help can save lives over here.
