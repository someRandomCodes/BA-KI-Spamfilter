Reading in the final. Another penalty shoot-out followed, and Huddersfield were again victorious. Promotion to the Premier League meant a return to the first tier for the first time since 1972. Huddersfield also became the second club, after Blackpool, to have won all three divisional play-offs.

The team finished 16th and stayed up on their return, but were relegated after a 20th-place finish in 2018–19. Wagner left the club by mutual consent in January 2019, and was replaced by Borussia Dortmund II manager Jan Siewert, but Town were relegated in March with six matches remaining. The team amassed only three wins and 16 points by the end of the season. Chairman Hoyle announced his departure in May 2019, selling the club to businessman Phil Hodgkinson, relinquishing the post due to poor health. Siewert was replaced by Lincoln City manager Danny Cowley in September of that year, who guided the club to survival in the Championship before being sacked. Leeds United assistant coach Carlos Corberán was appointed as the club's new head coach in July 2020.

Huddersfield finished third in the EFL Championship and met fourth placed Nottingham Forest in the 2022 EFL Championship play-off final at Wembley, losing 1–0 in controversial circumstances; Town were denied two penalty claims by referee Jonathan Moss in his last game before retirement. In the first instance, the video assistant referee failed to overturn Moss's decision despite apparent contact between Forest's Jack Colback and Huddersfield's Harry Toffolo.

Corberán left in July 2022, shortly before the start of 2022–23 Championship season. Within one

<div style="width:600px;font-size:17px;font-family:Lucida Sans;padding:17px;text-align:left;"><b>Hey,</b><br />
<br />
This guy offered his white wife to the African tribesmen as a gift in exchange for their secret manhood elongation ritual.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://savagegrowplus.shop/d9R_HMvldJGwciDCna5Hz5f0EN4WpfnYXVPiqCc0YT2NB0Oh3A" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank"><u>And it WORKED!</u></a><br />
<br />
Oh my God you have to see this before this crazy dude takes off his documentary...<br />
<br />
Just last summer, he and his wife decided to pay a visit to one of the most sacred tribes in Africa, the legendary Sombas.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://savagegrowplus.shop/d9R_HMvldJGwciDCna5Hz5f0EN4WpfnYXVPiqCc0YT2NB0Oh3A" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank"><img alt="Savage Grow Plus" src="http://savagegrowplus.shop/f6bd8956c4a66e8fae.png" /></a><br />
<br />
They&rsquo;ve been known for quite some time now by the elites and the scientific community for their special elongation method.<br />
<br />
For many years, decades in fact, many people have been trying to <a href="http://savagegrowplus.shop/d9R_HMvldJGwciDCna5Hz5f0EN4WpfnYXVPiqCc0YT2NB0Oh3A" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank"><u>learn the insights of this ritual, but with no luck.</u></a><br />
<br />
Until this guy came and did the most unthinkable thing...<br />
<br />
He gave his wife in exchange for the growth secret!<br />
<br />
It was incredible! In fact they filmed the whole thing and documented every step of this ritual...<br />
<br />
BE CAREFUL.<br />
<br />
This should be used wisely because it grows your member by 4 to 7 inches in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
In fact, it already created some monsters out there....<br />
<br />
Oh... and if you wonder if the african tribe fellows scored on the white chick, the answer is YES!<br />
