Whether you believe in God or not, read this message!

All throughout t=
ime, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to this point=
 where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Did you know that the B=
ible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?

In the book of R=
evelation 13:16-18, we read,

"He (the false prophet who deceives many =
by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and great, rich=
 and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on th=
eir foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mar=
k or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Here is wisdo=
m. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for i=
t is the number of a man: His number is 666."

Referring to the last ge=
neration, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelat=
ion 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark =
of the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell wi=
th one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scriptur=
e that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!

These verses could no=
t be referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture references two =
physical locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be =
on one "OR" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it would indica=
te both places, not one OR the
other.

This is where it really starts=
 to come together. It is shocking how
accurate the Bible is concerning th=
e implantable RFID microchip. These
are notes from a man named Carl Sande=
rs who worked with a team of
engineers to help develop this RFID chip
=

"Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
heads-of-=
state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to di=
scuss plans on how to bring about this one-world system.
The government c=
ommissioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and contro=
lling the peoples of the world=E2=80=94a microchip
that could be inserted=
 under the skin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient method that=
 would be gradually accepted by society).

Carl Sanders, with a team of=
 engineers behind him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dollars, to=
ok on this project and designed a
microchip that is powered by a lithium =
battery, rechargeable through
the temperature changes in our skin. Withou=
t the knowledge of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the =
time), these
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing researc=
h on the
best and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.=


Guess what? These researchers found that the forehead and the back of=

the hand (the two places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just=

the most convenient places, but are also the only viable places for
ra=
pid, consistent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the
lithium b=
attery. The microchip is approximately seven millimeters in
length, .75 m=
illimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is capable =
of storing pages upon pages of information about
you. All your general hi=
story, work history, criminal record, health
history, and financial data =
can be stored on this chip.

Brother Sanders believes that this microch=
ip, which he regretfully
helped design, is the =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D spo=
ken about in Revelation
13:16=E2=80=9318. The original Greek word for =
=E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D is =E2=80=9Ccharagma,=E2=80=9D
which means a =
=E2=80=9Cscratch or etching.=E2=80=9D It is also interesting to note
that=
 the number 666 is actually a word in the original Greek. The word
is =
=E2=80=9Cchi xi stigma,=E2=80=9D with the last part, =E2=80=9Cstigma,=
=E2=80=9D also meaning
=E2=80=9Cto stick or prick.=E2=80=9D Carl believes=
 this is referring to a
hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to=
 inject the
microchip."

Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen=
 if the lithium contained
within the RFID microchip leaked into the body.=
 The doctor replied by
saying a terrible sore would appear in that locati=
on. This is what the
book of Revelation says:

"And the first (angel)=
 went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and=
 grievous sore on the men which had the mark
of the beast, and on them wh=
ich worshipped his image" (Revelation
16:2).

You can read more about=
 it here--and to also understand the mystery
behind the number 666: TRUTH=
BIBLE.US

The =
third angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-11 states,

"Then a third ange=
l followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If
anyone worships the beast =
and his image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he h=
imself shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured =
out full strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be tormented =
with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the pre=
sence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever and eve=
r; and they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and his imag=
e, and whoever
receives the mark of his name.'"

Great hope is in our=
 midst, and is coming in a mighty way--the
greatest revival for Jesus in =
the history of the world where we will
see the most souls come to Him of =
all tribes, tongues, nations, and
peoples (Rev. 7:9-10); for we have this=
 promise in God's Word in the
midst of these dark times:

"Then I saw=
 an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the
bottomless pit a=
nd a great chain in his hand. He laid hold of the
dragon, that serpent of=
 old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him
for a thousand years (not=
 literal--rather a spiritual label for time
spent in eternity); and he ca=
st him into the bottomless pit, and shut
him up, and set a seal on him, s=
o that he should deceive the nations
no more till the thousand years were=
 finished. But after these things
he must be released for a little while =
(when the Antichrist and false
prophet will rise up and God will test the=
 world)." (Revelation
20:1-3)

"The coming of the lawless one (the An=
tichrist) is according to the
working of Satan, with all power, signs, an=
d lying wonders, and with
all unrighteous deception among those who peris=
h, because they did not
receive the love of the truth, that they might be=
 saved. And for this
reason God will send them strong delusion, that they=
 should believe
the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not belie=
ve the truth
but had pleasure in unrighteousness." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-1=
2)"

Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still in the public scene?
=

So what about his name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot
ab=
out a person. God throughout history has given names to people that
have =
a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack
Obama? =
Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.

Jesus sa=
ys in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from
heaven."

=
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q"
(baw=
-rawk)

In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) s=
aying
in his heart:

"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, =
I will be like the
Most High."

In the verses in Isaiah that refer di=
rectly to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him falling from the heights=
 or the heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights or heavens used here is =
Hebrew Strongs 1116:
"bamah"--Pronounced (bam-maw')

In Hebrew, the l=
etter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U"
or "O," and it is p=
rimarily used as a conjunction to join concepts
together. So to join in H=
ebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a high place like heave=
n or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter "U" or "O" would be used=
. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U"
Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry similar to =
the style written in Isaiah, would
translate literally to "Lightning from=
 the heights." The word "Satan"
in Hebrew is a direct translation, theref=
ore "Satan."

So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He be=
held Satan
fall like lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by =
a Jewish
Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he w=
ould
say these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and =
I
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.

The names of both of Obama's daughte=
rs are Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backward (the d=
evil does things in reverse)
we would get "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remo=
ve the letters that spell
"Alah" (Allah being the false god of Islam), we=
 get "I am Satan".
Coincidence? I don't think so.

Obama's campaign l=
ogo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the west, with the =
landscape as the flag of the United States. In
Islam, they have their own=
 messiah that they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (th=
e Antichrist of the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this man's appear=
ance is the sun rising in the
west.

"Then I saw another angel flying=
 in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach to those=
 who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to
every nation, tribe, tongue, and peopl=
e=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory to Him, for=
 the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and e=
arth, the sea and springs
of water.'" (Revelation 14:6-7)

Why have t=
he words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, burial, and=
 resurrection, been translated into over 3,000
languages, and nothing com=
es close (the Quran about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit of God =
(YHVH) who created all people likewise
transcends all people; therefore t=
he power of His Word is not limited
by people; while all other religions =
are man-made, therefore they tend
to primarily stay within their own cult=
ure. The same God who speaks to
all people through His creation of the he=
avens and earth that draws
all people around the world likewise has sent =
His Word to the ends of
the earth so that we may come to personally know =
Him to be saved in
spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.
=

Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh=

the scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good
t=
han bad in this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court =
of law? Bearing the image of God, is this how we project this
image into =
reality?

Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, bei=
ng guilty
of a crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have don=
e, but
rather by the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,=

created in God's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a
per=
fect, righteous, and Holy God?

God has brought down His moral laws thr=
ough the 10 commandments given
to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not=
 given so we may be
justified, but rather that we may see the need for a =
savior. They are
the mirror of God's character of what He has written in =
our hearts,
with our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is wr=
ong to
steal, lie, dishonor our parents, murder, and so forth.

We ca=
n try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we
will never=
 catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That
same word of th=
e law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Je=
sus Christ. He came to be our justification by
fulfilling the law, living=
 a sinless perfect life that only God could
fulfill.

The gap between=
 us and the law can never be reconciled by our own
merit, but the arm of =
Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of
God. And if we are to gr=
ab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us
up being the one to justify =
us. As in the court of law, if someone
steps in and pays our fine, even t=
hough we are guilty, the judge can
do what is legal and just and let us g=
o free. That is what Jesus did
almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It wa=
s a legal transaction being
fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shedd=
ing of His blood with His
last word's on the cross crying out, "It is fin=
ished!" (John 19:30).

For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wi=
cked (Ezekiel 18:23).
This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks o=
f the coming
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it =
says it
pleased God to crush His only begotten Son.

This is because =
the wrath that we deserve was justified by being
poured out upon His Son.=
 If that wrath was poured out on us, we would
all perish to hell forever.=
 God created a way of escape by pouring it
out on His Son whose soul coul=
d not be left in Hades but was raised
and seated at the right hand of God=
 in power.

So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14),=
 where God
no longer sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather t=
he
glorious image of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if=

we received the wrath we deserve, making a way of escape from the
curs=
e of death; now being conformed into the image of the heavenly man
walkin=
g in a new nature, and no longer in the image of the fallen man
Adam.
=

Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the
savio=
r, confessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy
Spirit that=
 we may be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again
to see and en=
ter the Kingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not
just head knowledg=
e of believing in Jesus, but rather receiving His
words, taking them to h=
eart, so that we may truly be transformed into
the image of God. Where we=
 no longer live to practice sin, but rather
turn from our sins and practi=
ce righteousness through faith in Him in
obedience to His Word by reading=
 the Bible.

Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is n=
ot that we
earn our way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord =
Jesus
Christ:

Jesus says,

=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me,=
 =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he =
who does the will of My Father in heaven.
Many will say to Me in that day=
, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in Your name, cast out demo=
ns in Your name, and done many wonders in
Your name?=E2=80=99 And then I =
will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew you;
depart from Me, you who =
practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)

"And having been perf=
ected, He became the author of eternal salvation
to all who obey Him." (H=
ebrews 5:9)

"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first hea=
ven and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then=
 I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven fro=
m God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud vo=
ice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and H=
e
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will
=
be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from
the=
ir eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shal=
l be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.'

Then He wh=
o sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
And He said to=
 me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'

And He said to me=
, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End. I=
 will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirsts=
. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and he=
 shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, s=
exually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their par=
t in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second de=
ath.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8)

<br />
"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottoml=
ess pit and a great chain in his hand. He laid hold of the dragon, that ser=
pent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years=
 (not literal--rather a spiritual label for time spent in eternity); and he=
 cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, =
so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were =
finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while (wh=
en the Antichrist and false prophet will rise up and God will test the worl=
d)." (Revelation 20:1-3)<br />
<br />
"The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to the working=
 of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteo=
us deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love =
of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send t=
hem strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be=
 condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousnes=
s." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)"<br />
<br />
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still in the public scene?<br />
<br />
So what about his name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot about a=
 person. God throughout history has given names to people that have a speci=
fic meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us ta=
ke a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."=
<br />
<br />
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q" (baw-r=
awk)<br />
<br />
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying in his=
 heart:<br />
<br />
"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most Hig=
h."<br />
<br />
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times it me=
ntions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew word for the=
 heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116: "bamah"--Pronounced (=
bam-maw')<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U" or "O=
," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts together. So =
to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq) and a high place =
like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the letter "U" or "O" would=
 be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U" Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry simil=
ar to the style written in Isaiah, would translate literally to "Lightning =
from the heights." The word "Satan" in Hebrew is a direct translation, ther=
efore "Satan."<br />
<br />
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan fall li=
ke lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish Rabbi today=
 influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would say these words i=
n Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I saw Satan as Baraq O B=
am-Maw.<br />
<br />
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we were to=
 write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse) we would get=
 "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah bei=
ng the false god of Islam), we get "I am Satan". Coincidence? I don't think=
 so.<br />
<br />
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon in the=
 west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In Islam, they =
have their own messiah that they are waiting for called the 12th Imam, or t=
he Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one prophecy concerning this ma=
n's appearance is the sun rising in the west.<br />
<br />
"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlas=
ting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to every nati=
on, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God =
and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship H=
im who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.'" (Revelation 1=
4:6-7)<br />
<br />
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His death, bur=
ial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000 languages, and nothi=
ng comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)? Because the same Spirit of =
God (YHVH) who created all people likewise transcends all people; therefore=
 the power of His Word is not limited by people; while all other religions =
are man-made, therefore they tend to primarily stay within their own cultur=
e. The same God who speaks to all people through His creation of the heaven=
s and earth that draws all people around the world likewise has sent His Wo=
rd to the ends of the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to b=
e saved in spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh the =
scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good than bad i=
n this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a court of law? Bea=
ring the image of God, is this how we project this image into reality?<br /=
>
<br />
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty of a=
 crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but rather by=
 the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's i=
mage, pose this type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Ho=
ly God?<br />
<br />
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given to Mo=
ses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be justified, but rat=
her that we may see the need for a savior. They are the mirror of God's cha=
racter of what He has written in our hearts, with our conscious bearing wit=
ness that we know that it is wrong to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, mur=
der, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we will ne=
ver catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That same word of t=
he law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago in the body of Jes=
us Christ. He came to be our justification by fulfilling the law, living a =
sinless perfect life that only God could fulfill.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own merit, bu=
t the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. And if w=
e are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us up being the one to=
 justify us. As in the court of law, if someone steps in and pays our fine,=
 even though we are guilty, the judge can do what is legal and just and let=
 us go free. That is what Jesus did almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It=
 was a legal transaction being fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shed=
ding of His blood with His last word's on the cross crying out, "It is fini=
shed!" (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). This =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to crush Hi=
s only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would all perish to h=
ell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it out on His Son whose=
 soul could not be left in Hades but was raised and seated at the right han=
d of God in power.<br />
<br />
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God no lo=
nger sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image =
of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if we received the wrat=
h we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death; now being con=
formed into the image of the heavenly man walking in a new nature, and no l=
onger in the image of the fallen man Adam.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the savior, co=
nfessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy Spirit that we may=
 be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again to see and enter the K=
ingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not just head knowledge of believ=
ing in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart, so that=
 we may truly be transformed into the image of God. Where we no longer live=
 to practice sin, but rather turn from our sins and practice righteousness =
through faith in Him in obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.<br />
<br />
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we earn o=
ur way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus Christ:<br />
<br />
Jesus says,<br />
<br />
=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall e=
nter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven=
. Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophes=
ied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Yo=
ur name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew yo=
u; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)=
<br />
<br />
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to al=
l who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8)<br />
