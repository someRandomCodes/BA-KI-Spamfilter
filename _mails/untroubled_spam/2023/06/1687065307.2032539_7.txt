br>
Greetings, Please let this not sound strange to you because I am not asking=
 you for money, for my only surviving lawyer who would have done this, died=
 early last year. I prayed and got your email address from your country's g=
uest book and I wish to visit once more if God willing in his infinite merc=
ies grant me. In function of your good profile, I want to solicit your assi=
stance in the discharge of my Will. I am mrs. Maria Paxton, from London and=
 am aged 73 years suffering from endometrial=20
cancer. Please, I want you to help me create a charitable project with the =
money that I inherited from my deceased husband who died in a motor acciden=
t. I was brought up from a motherless baby's home and was married to my lat=
e husband for twenty nine years without a child.</p><p>
My friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness and I canno=
t live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them=
 anymore, so I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum o=
f 11,000,000.00 GBP (Eleven Million Pounds) with my bank. All I need is an =
honest person who will use at least %60 of the funds as I would instruct, t=
hen the rest %40 will go to you for helping me accomplish this mission beca=
use donating this money to charity is the only=20
legacy I can leave behind after my death. No money is required from you to =
carry on with this project because it is my heart desire to make a generous=
 gift to you to work for a charity in your country. I don't mind if you are=
 a Christian or Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist rather my only paramount concer=
n here is whether I can trust you because this generation is filled up with=
 greedy and fraudulent people all over the world. I will give you more deta=
ils as soon as I hear from you.</p><p>
Looking forward to your urgent response.</p><p>Kind regards.<br>Mrs.Maria P=
axton<br></p></body></html>
