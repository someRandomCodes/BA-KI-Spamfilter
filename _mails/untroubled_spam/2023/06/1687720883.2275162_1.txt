Flushing Trick = No More Pumping Your Septic Tank

The MRT is the oldest, busiest, and most comprehensive metro system in Southeast Asia.[note 12] Capital expenditure on its rail infrastructure reached a cumulative S$150 billion[note 13] in 2021, making the network one of the world's costliest on both a per-kilometre and absolute basis.[note 14] The system is managed in conformity with a semi-nationalised hybrid regulatory framework; construction and procurement fall under the purview of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), a statutory board of the government that allocates operating concessions to the for-profit private corporations SMRT and SBS Transit. These operators are responsible for asset maintenance on their respective lines, and also run bus services, facilitating operational synchronicity and the horizontal integration of the broader public transportation network.

The MRT is fully automated and has an extensive driverless rapid transit system. Asset renewal works are periodically carried out to modernise the network and ensure its continued reliability; all stations feature platform screen doors, Wi-Fi connectivity, lifts, climate control, and accessibility provisions, among others. Much of the early network is elevated above ground on concrete viaducts, with a small portion running at-grade; newer lines are largely subterranean, incorporating several of the lengthiest continuous subway tunnel sections in the world. A number of underground stations double as purpose-built air raid shelters under the operational authority
