Eat one tablespoon of THIS each day

The preindustrial age has been dubbed by Werner Sombart and others as the 'wooden age', as timber and firewood were the basic resources for energy, construction and housing. The development of modern forestry is closely connected with the rise of capitalism, the economy as a science and varying notions of land use and property. Roman Latifundiae, large agricultural estates, were quite successful in maintaining the large supply of wood that was necessary for the Roman Empire. Large deforestations came with the decline of the Romans. However already in the 5th century, monks in the then Byzantine Romagna on the Adriatic coast, were able to establish stone pine plantations to provide fuelwood and food. This was the beginning of the massive forest mentioned by Dante Alighieri in his 1308 poem Divine Comedy.

Similar sustainable formal forestry practices were developed by the Visigoths in the 7th century when, faced with the ever-increasing shortage of wood, they instituted a code concerned with the preservation of oak and pine forests. The use and management of many forest resources has a long history in China as well, dating back to the Han dynasty and taking place under the landowning gentry. A similar approach was used in Japan. It was also later written about by the Ming dynasty Chinese scholar Xu Guangqi (1562â€“1633).

In Europe, land usage rights in medieval and early modern times allowed different users to access forests and pastures. Plant litter and resin extraction were important, as pitch (resin) was essential for the caulking of ships, falking and hunting rights, firewood and building, timber gathering in wood pastures, and for grazing animals in forests. The notion of "commons" (German "Allmende") refers to the underlying traditional legal term of common land. The idea of enclosed private property came about during modern times. However, most hunting rights were retained by members of the nobi

What if it only took 10 seconds each morning to&hellip;
<ul>
	<li>End joint pain, swelling and stiffness for good</li>
	<li>Soothe inflammation</li>
	<li>All while improving flexibility and mobility</li>
</ul>
Well that&rsquo;s exactly what happened when researchers gave patients 1 tablespoon of this weird <b>&ldquo;gelatin.&rdquo;</b><br />

<br />
67-year-old grandma, Sarah Gaynor put this weird <b>&ldquo;gelatin&rdquo;</b> to the test after she&rsquo;d suffered two decades of pure torture.<br />
<br />
Not only did she feel instant relief from her endless agony...<br />
<br />
She could finally put an end to her &quot;hopeless&quot; case of joint pain for good!<br />
<br />
And you can too&hellip;<br />

<b>P.S.</b> Farmers in Japan have been eating this weird <b>&ldquo;gelatin&rdquo; </b>for generations. Which is why these folks can work in the fields &mdash; comfortably bending, squatting and twisting &mdash; well into their 70s, 80s, and even 90s&hellip;<br />
