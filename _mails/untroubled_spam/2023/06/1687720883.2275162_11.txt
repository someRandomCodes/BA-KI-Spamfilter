The Supply System Collapse - Stealing The Food From Your Kids’ Tables

The ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.

The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. The situation greatly disadvantaged American and Western European athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism

<br />
You might find this <strong>DISTURBING,</strong> but I have to share it.<br />
<br />
Media isn&rsquo;t saying a word about <strong><a href="http://altaibalancez.today/WCH5A3D_RQHs_PgzaTApurXxtE29L9HWBty-Es7tNfxjlpoZ4w" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="text-decoration:none;" target="blank">THIS</a></strong> since it would create <strong>MASS HYSTERIA and CHAOS.</strong><br />

<br />
BUT, BEFORE YOU DO, KNOW THAT&hellip;</center>
<br />
<br />
&hellip;It has NOTHING to do with potential <strong>nuclear attacks, EMP&rsquo;s</strong> or even terrorism!<br />
<br />
It has NOTHING to do with <strong>Russia</strong> or <strong>China</strong> or any outside forces!<br />
<br />
No. The threat is <strong>right here,</strong> in our <strong>&ldquo;backyards&rdquo; </strong>and it will cause millions to beg at the food line, pray for food stamps and scrape for scraps of rotten bread just to feed their children.<br />
<br />
And if you want to avoid it I urge you to<a href="http://altaibalancez.today/WCH5A3D_RQHs_PgzaTApurXxtE29L9HWBty-Es7tNfxjlpoZ4w" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold;" target="blank"> take a look at THIS right now.</a><br />
