My Dear Beloved Friend,
Greetings, Please let this not sound strange to you because I am=20
not asking you for money, for my only surviving lawyer who would=20
have done this, died early last year. I
prayed and got your email address from your country's guest book=20
and I wish to visit once more if God willing in his infinite=20
mercies grant me. In function of your good profile, I want to=20
solicit your assistance in the discharge of my Will. I am mrs.=20
Maria Paxton, from London and am aged 73 years suffering from=20
endometrial cancer. Please, I want you to help me create a=20
charitable project with the money that I inherited from my=20
deceased husband who died in a motor accident. I was brought up=20
from a motherless baby's home and was married to my late husband=20
for twenty nine years without a child.

My friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness=20
and I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge=20
responsibility to any of them anymore, so I sold all my inherited=20
belongings and deposited all the sum of 11,000,000.00 GBP (Eleven=20
Million Pounds) with my bank. All I need is an honest person who=20
will use at least %60 of the funds as I would instruct, then the=20
rest %40 will go to you for helping me accomplish this mission=20
because donating this money to charity is the only legacy I can=20
leave behind after my death. No money is required from you to=20
carry on with this project because it is my heart desire to make=20
a generous gift to you to work for a charity in your country. I=20
don't mind if you are a Christian or Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist=20
rather my only paramount concern here is whether I can trust you=20
because this generation is filled up with greedy and fraudulent=20
people all over the world. I will give you more details as soon=20
as I hear from you.

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Kind regards.
Mrs.Maria Paxton
