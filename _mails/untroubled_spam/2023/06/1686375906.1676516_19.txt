In 1953, a Jacksonville, Florida, man named Keith Kramer, along with his wi=
fe's uncle Matthew Burns, looked to create a restaurant idea of their own a=
fter being inspired by the original McDonald's restaurant in San Bernardino=
, California.  As part of their new restaurant, they bought the rights to a=
 special grill machine called the Insta-Broiler, and named their restaurant=
 "Insta-Burger King. " Several years later, the idea had grown into several=
 restaurant locations and was picked up by a pair of Cornell University cla=
ssmates, James McLamore and David Edgerton.  Burger King Origins McLamore a=
nd Edgerton started by purchasing one Insta-Burger King franchise in Miami =
in 1954.  The growth of the Miami metropolitan area made it an excellent lo=
cation for starting a new chain, but an adjustment had to be made to furthe=
r improve on the Insta-Broiler machine.  McLamore and Edgerton came up with=
 a gas grill that they called a "flame broiler," and it eliminated the prob=
lems of the Insta-Broiler.  By 1959 the Insta-Burger chain had grown, but t=
he Kramer-Burns operation had run into financial trouble, and McLamore and =
Edgerton bought out the entire company to restructure and revitalize its op=
erations.  By 1961, the rechristened Burger King and its signature burger, =
the Whopper, had begun to spread across the United States.  In 1967, the Pi=
llsbury Company bought Burger King Corporation for $18 million, and with th=
e baking company's capital behind it, by the late 1970s Burger King was abl=
e to grow to become America's second-largest burger chain, just behind McDo=
nald's.=20
