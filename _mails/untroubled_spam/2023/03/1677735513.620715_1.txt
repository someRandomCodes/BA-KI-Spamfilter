Norman Edward Hugo.  I wish to notify you that the late Engr. Norman
Edward Hugo made you a beneficiary of his WILL. He left the sum of Thirty
Million, One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($30,100.000.00 USD) to you in
the Codicil and last testament to his WILL.

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you, but it is real and
true. Being a widely traveled man, he must have been in contact with
you in the past or simply you were nominated to him by one of his
numerous friends abroad who wished you good. late Engr. Norman
Edward Hugo until his death was a member of the Helicopter Society and
the Institute of Electronic & Electrical Engineers. He was a very dedicated
Christian who loved to give out. His great philanthropy earned him numerous
awards during his lifetime. Late Engr. Norman Edward Hugo died on the 13th
day of March 2022 at the age of 80 years, and his WILL is now ready  
for execution.
According to him, this money is to support your humanitarian activities
and to help the poor and the needy in our society. Please if I reach
you as I am hopeful, endeavor to get back to me as soon as possible to
enable me to conclude my job.
