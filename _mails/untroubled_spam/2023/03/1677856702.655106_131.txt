You may have noticed that we are using your company's server to send this m=

<span style=3D"font-family: Arial;"><span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">Our te=
am found several vulnerabilities within your website and company computers =
that we were able to exploit. After finding them, we were able to obtain th=
eir database credentials and extract their complete data from their compute=
rs, from their site and copies of all emails in all their mailboxes with&nb=
sp;untroubled.org domain and finally we moved the information to a foreign =
server.</span></span></span></span><br><br>

We will systematically go through a series of steps to totally damage your =
reputation. First, your database will be leaked or sold to the highest bidd=
er to be used for any purpose. Next, emails will be sent to all your custom=
ers, suppliers and business partners, stating that all of their information=
 has been sold or leaked and your&nbsp;https://www.untroubled.org site was =
at fault for leaking the information and damaging the reputation of all you=
r customers and providers. Lastly, any links you=20
have indexed in search=20
engines will be de-indexed based on the blackhat techniques we have used in=
 the past to de-index our targets, not to mention getting your business on =
every blacklist in the country.</span></span></span></span><br><br><span st=

<span style=3D"font-size: 12pt;">We are willing to forget about destroying =
the reputation of your site and company for a small fee. The current fee is=
 2,000 (two thousand US&nbsp;dollars) in Bitcoins.</span></span></span></sp=

If you decide not to pay, we will launch the attack after 72 hours and keep=
 it until you do, there is no countermeasure to this, you will just end up =
wasting more money trying to find a solution. We will completely destroy yo=

This is not a hoax, do not try to reason or negotiate, we will not read any=
 answers. Once you've paid, we'll stop what we were doing, we'll destroy al=
