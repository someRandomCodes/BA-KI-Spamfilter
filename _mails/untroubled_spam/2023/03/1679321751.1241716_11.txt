Regardless if you believe in God or not, this message is a
"must-read"!=


All throughout time, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned t=
o
come to this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
D=
id you know that the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?=


In Revelation 13:16-18, we read,

"He (the false prophet who dece=
ives many by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and g=
reat, rich and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right han=
d or on their foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who h=
as the mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Her=
e is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the be=
ast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666."

Speaking to th=
e last generation, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why=
? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive =
the mark of the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy o=
r sell with one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict=
 scripture that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!

These verses=
 could not be referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture refere=
nces two physical locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark=
 will be on one "OR" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it wou=
ld indicate both places, not one OR the
other.

This is where it real=
ly starts to come together. It is shocking how
accurate the Bible is conc=
erning the implantable RFID microchip. These
are notes from a man named C=
arl Sanders who worked with a team of
engineers to help develop this RFID=
 chip

"Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
h=
eads-of-state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.=
A. to discuss plans on how to bring about this one-world system.
The gove=
rnment commissioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying an=
d controlling the peoples of the world=E2=80=94a microchip
that could be =
inserted under the skin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient met=
hod that would be gradually accepted by society).

Carl Sanders, with a=
 team of engineers behind him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dol=
lars, took on this project and designed a
microchip that is powered by a =
lithium battery, rechargeable through
the temperature changes in our skin=
. Without the knowledge of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian=
 at the time), these
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing=
 research on the
best and most convenient place to have the microchip ins=
erted.

Guess what? These researchers found that the forehead and the b=
ack of
the hand (the two places the Bible says the mark will go) are not =
just
the most convenient places, but are also the only viable places for=

rapid, consistent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the
lith=
ium battery. The microchip is approximately seven millimeters in
length, =
.75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is cap=
able of storing pages upon pages of information about
you. All your gener=
al history, work history, criminal record, health
history, and financial =
data can be stored on this chip.

Brother Sanders believes that this mi=
crochip, which he regretfully
helped design, is the =E2=80=9Cmark=
=E2=80=9D spoken about in Revelation
13:16=E2=80=9318. The original Greek=
 word for =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D is =E2=80=9Ccharagma,=E2=80=9D
which mea=
ns a =E2=80=9Cscratch or etching.=E2=80=9D It is also interesting to note=

that the number 666 is actually a word in the original Greek. The word=

is =E2=80=9Cchi xi stigma,=E2=80=9D with the last part, =E2=80=9Cstigma,=
=E2=80=9D also meaning
=E2=80=9Cto stick or prick.=E2=80=9D Carl believes=
 this is referring to a
hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to=
 inject the
microchip."

Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen=
 if the lithium contained
within the RFID microchip leaked into the body.=
 The doctor replied by
saying a terrible sore would appear in that locati=
on. This is what the
book of Revelation says:

"And the first (angel)=
 went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and=
 grievous sore on the men which had the mark
of the beast, and on them wh=
ich worshipped his image" (Revelation
16:2).

You can read more about=
 it here--and to also understand the mystery
behind the number 666: TRUTH=
BIBLE.US
[https://edu-florida.us/index.php/campaigns/wk534ptjk1abc/track-=
url/tj421tgg9a6f4/23812df7d589c761301c09ac52f5b18496812873]

The third =
angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-11 states,

"Then a third angel foll=
owed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If
anyone worships the beast and hi=
s image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he himself=
 shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out fu=
ll strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be tormented with f=
ire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the presence =
of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and=
 they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and=
 whoever
receives the mark of his name.'"

Great hope is in our midst=
, and is coming in a mighty way--the
greatest revival for Jesus in the hi=
story of the world where we will
see the most souls come to Him of all tr=
ibes, tongues, nations, and
peoples (Rev. 7:9-10); for we have this promi=
se in God's Word in the
midst of these dark times:

"Then I saw an an=
gel coming down from heaven, having the key to the
bottomless pit and a g=
reat chain in his hand. He laid hold of the
dragon, that serpent of old, =
who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him
for a thousand years (not liter=
al--rather a spiritual label for time
spent in eternity); and he cast him=
 into the bottomless pit, and shut
him up, and set a seal on him, so that=
 he should deceive the nations
no more till the thousand years were finis=
hed. But after these things
he must be released for a little while (when =
the Antichrist and false
prophet will rise up and God will test the world=
)." (Revelation
20:1-3)

"The coming of the lawless one (the Antichri=
st) is according to the
working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lyin=
g wonders, and with
all unrighteous deception among those who perish, bec=
ause they did not
receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved=
. And for this
reason God will send them strong delusion, that they shoul=
d believe
the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the=
 truth
but had pleasure in unrighteousness." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)"
=

Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still in the public scene?

So wh=
at about his name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot
about a pe=
rson. God throughout history has given names to people that
have a specif=
ic meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack
Obama? Let us t=
ake a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.

Jesus says in Lu=
ke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from
heaven."

The Hebr=
ew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q"
(baw-rawk)=


In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying=

in his heart:

"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I wil=
l be like the
Most High."

In the verses in Isaiah that refer directl=
y to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him falling from the heights or t=
he heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights or heavens used here is Hebre=
w Strongs 1116:
"bamah"--Pronounced (bam-maw')

In Hebrew, the letter=
 "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U"
or "O," and it is primar=
ily used as a conjunction to join concepts
together. So to join in Hebrew=
 poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a high place like heaven or =
the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter "U" or "O" would be used. So,=
 Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U"
Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry similar to the s=
tyle written in Isaiah, would
translate literally to "Lightning from the =
heights." The word "Satan"
in Hebrew is a direct translation, therefore "=
Satan."

So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld =
Satan
fall like lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jew=
ish
Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would=

say these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I
=
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.

The names of both of Obama's daughters a=
re Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backward (the devil=
 does things in reverse)
we would get "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove t=
he letters that spell
"Alah" (Allah being the false god of Islam), we get=
 "I am Satan".
Coincidence? I don't think so.

Obama's campaign logo =
when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the west, with the land=
scape as the flag of the United States. In
Islam, they have their own mes=
siah that they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (the An=
tichrist of the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this man's appearance=
 is the sun rising in the
west.

"Then I saw another angel flying in =
the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach to those who=
 dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people=
=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory to Him, for =
the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and ea=
rth, the sea and springs
of water.'" (Revelation 14:6-7)

Why have th=
e words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, burial, and =
resurrection, been translated into over 3,000
languages, and nothing come=
s close (the Quran about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit of God (=
YHVH) who created all people likewise
transcends all people; therefore th=
e power of His Word is not limited
by people; while all other religions a=
re man-made, therefore they tend
to primarily stay within their own cultu=
re. The same God who speaks to
all people through His creation of the hea=
vens and earth that draws
all people around the world likewise has sent H=
is Word to the ends of
the earth so that we may come to personally know H=
im to be saved in
spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.

=
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh
th=
e scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good
than b=
ad in this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court of la=
w? Bearing the image of God, is this how we project this
image into reali=
ty?

Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being gu=
ilty
of a crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, bu=
t
rather by the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,
cre=
ated in God's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a
perfect, =
righteous, and Holy God?

God has brought down His moral laws through t=
he 10 commandments given
to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given=
 so we may be
justified, but rather that we may see the need for a savior=
. They are
the mirror of God's character of what He has written in our he=
arts,
with our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is wrong to=

steal, lie, dishonor our parents, murder, and so forth.

We can try =
and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we
will never catch=
 up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That
same word of the law =
given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Jesus Ch=
rist. He came to be our justification by
fulfilling the law, living a sin=
less perfect life that only God could
fulfill.

The gap between us an=
d the law can never be reconciled by our own
merit, but the arm of Jesus =
is stretched out by the grace and mercy of
God. And if we are to grab on,=
 through faith in Him, He will pull us
up being the one to justify us. As=
 in the court of law, if someone
steps in and pays our fine, even though =
we are guilty, the judge can
do what is legal and just and let us go free=
. That is what Jesus did
almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It was a le=
gal transaction being
fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shedding of=
 His blood with His
last word's on the cross crying out, "It is finished!=
" (John 19:30).

For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (=
Ezekiel 18:23).
This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the =
coming
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says i=
t
pleased God to crush His only begotten Son.

This is because the wr=
ath that we deserve was justified by being
poured out upon His Son. If th=
at wrath was poured out on us, we would
all perish to hell forever. God c=
reated a way of escape by pouring it
out on His Son whose soul could not =
be left in Hades but was raised
and seated at the right hand of God in po=
wer.

So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where=
 God
no longer sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the
g=
lorious image of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if
we r=
eceived the wrath we deserve, making a way of escape from the
curse of de=
ath; now being conformed into the image of the heavenly man
walking in a =
new nature, and no longer in the image of the fallen man
Adam.

Now w=
hat we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the
savior, confe=
ssing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy
Spirit that we may =
be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again
to see and enter the =
Kingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not
just head knowledge of bel=
ieving in Jesus, but rather receiving His
words, taking them to heart, so=
 that we may truly be transformed into
the image of God. Where we no long=
er live to practice sin, but rather
turn from our sins and practice right=
eousness through faith in Him in
obedience to His Word by reading the Bib=
le.

Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that =
we
earn our way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus
=
Christ:

Jesus says,

=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =
=E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he w=
ho does the will of My Father in heaven.
Many will say to Me in that day,=
 =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in Your name, cast out demon=
s in Your name, and done many wonders in
Your name?=E2=80=99 And then I w=
ill declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew you;
depart from Me, you who p=
ractice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)

"And having been perfe=
cted, He became the author of eternal salvation
to all who obey Him." (He=
brews 5:9)

"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heav=
en and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then =
I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from=
 God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voi=
ce
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He=

will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will
b=
e with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from
thei=
r eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shall=
 be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.'

Then He who=
 sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
And He said to =
me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'

And He said to me,=
 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End. I =
will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirsts.=
 He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and he =
shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, se=
xually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part=
 in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second dea=
th.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8)

nd ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his =
image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"<br />
<br />
Great hope is in our midst, and is coming in a mighty way--the greatest rev=
ival for Jesus in the history of the world where we will see the most souls=
 come to Him of all tribes, tongues, nations, and peoples (Rev. 7:9-10); fo=
r we have this promise in God's Word in the midst of these dark times:<br /=

<br />
"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottoml=
ess pit and a great chain in his hand. He laid hold of the dragon, that ser=
pent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years=
 (not literal--rather a spiritual label for time spent in eternity); and he=
 cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, =
so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were =
finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while (wh=
en the Antichrist and false prophet will rise up and God will test the worl=
d)." (Revelation 20:1-3)<br />
<br />
"The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to the working=
 of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteo=
us deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love =
of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send t=
hem strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be=
 condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousnes=
s." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)"<br />
<br />
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still in the public scene?<br />
<br />
So what about his name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot about a=
 person. God throughout history has given names to people that have a speci=
fic meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us ta=
ke a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."=
<br />
<br />
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q" (baw-r=
awk)<br />
<br />
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying in his=
 heart:<br />
<br />
"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most Hig=
h."<br />
<br />
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times it me=
ntions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew word for the=
 heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116: "bamah"--Pronounced (=
bam-maw')<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U" or "O=
," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts together. So =
to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq) and a high place =
like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the letter "U" or "O" would=
 be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U" Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry simil=
ar to the style written in Isaiah, would translate literally to "Lightning =
from the heights." The word "Satan" in Hebrew is a direct translation, ther=
efore "Satan."<br />
<br />
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan fall li=
ke lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish Rabbi today=
 influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would say these words i=
n Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I saw Satan as Baraq O B=
am-Maw.<br />
<br />
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we were to=
 write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse) we would get=
 "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah bei=
ng the false god of Islam), we get "I am Satan". Coincidence? I don't think=
 so.<br />
<br />
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon in the=
 west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In Islam, they =
have their own messiah that they are waiting for called the 12th Imam, or t=
he Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one prophecy concerning this ma=
n's appearance is the sun rising in the west.<br />
<br />
"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlas=
ting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to every nati=
on, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God =
and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship H=
im who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.'" (Revelation 1=
4:6-7)<br />
<br />
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His death, bur=
ial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000 languages, and nothi=
ng comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)? Because the same Spirit of =
God (YHVH) who created all people likewise transcends all people; therefore=
 the power of His Word is not limited by people; while all other religions =
are man-made, therefore they tend to primarily stay within their own cultur=
e. The same God who speaks to all people through His creation of the heaven=
s and earth that draws all people around the world likewise has sent His Wo=
rd to the ends of the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to b=
e saved in spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh the =
scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good than bad i=
n this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a court of law? Bea=
ring the image of God, is this how we project this image into reality?<br /=
>
<br />
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty of a=
 crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but rather by=
 the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's i=
mage, pose this type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Ho=
ly God?<br />
<br />
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given to Mo=
ses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be justified, but rat=
her that we may see the need for a savior. They are the mirror of God's cha=
racter of what He has written in our hearts, with our conscious bearing wit=
ness that we know that it is wrong to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, mur=
der, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we will ne=
ver catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That same word of t=
he law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago in the body of Jes=
us Christ. He came to be our justification by fulfilling the law, living a =
sinless perfect life that only God could fulfill.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own merit, bu=
t the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. And if w=
e are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us up being the one to=
 justify us. As in the court of law, if someone steps in and pays our fine,=
 even though we are guilty, the judge can do what is legal and just and let=
 us go free. That is what Jesus did almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It=
 was a legal transaction being fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shed=
ding of His blood with His last word's on the cross crying out, "It is fini=
shed!" (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). This =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to crush Hi=
s only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would all perish to h=
ell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it out on His Son whose=
 soul could not be left in Hades but was raised and seated at the right han=
d of God in power.<br />
<br />
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God no lo=
nger sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image =
of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if we received the wrat=
h we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death; now being con=
formed into the image of the heavenly man walking in a new nature, and no l=
onger in the image of the fallen man Adam.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the savior, co=
nfessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy Spirit that we may=
 be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again to see and enter the K=
ingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not just head knowledge of believ=
ing in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart, so that=
 we may truly be transformed into the image of God. Where we no longer live=
 to practice sin, but rather turn from our sins and practice righteousness =
through faith in Him in obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.<br />
<br />
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we earn o=
ur way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus Christ:<br />
<br />
Jesus says,<br />
<br />
=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall e=
nter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven=
. Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophes=
ied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Yo=
ur name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew yo=
u; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)=
<br />
<br />
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to al=
l who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8)<br />
