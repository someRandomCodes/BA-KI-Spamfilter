Tired of Your Old and Dirty Sofa?

Also, not to mention, they looked like they won’t be able to survive more than one duel against my little kitten’s claws.

I found something that changed my expectations of what a sofa cover can be completely.

The company was called Coverlastic.

I checked out a couple of positive reviews, and decided to take the plunge and order one of their golden-brown spandex-lycra cover versions.
