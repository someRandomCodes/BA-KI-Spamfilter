<p> Suddenly he cried out, What do I FEED you for?  Intent upon putting into execution a scheme which he had hastily planned that very afternoon, he repaired to the quarter inhabited by the Christians.   They were capable and honest men but too philosophical and too moderate to survive during these frightful years.   Every wave that she threw aside brought us nearer home, and every day s observation at noon showed a progress which, if it continued, would in less than five months, take us into Boston Bay.  For the last time in his life, he had been the engineer.   Yet these were Christians!  He scuffled and waded across the wheat, groping in the dark with outstretched hands.   He lived and died and left no trace of his existence except a few collar-bones and a few pieces of his skull.   There have been several revolutions during the last century and there is not much left of the old city.   If Photius had not been so wretchedly concise, we should derive much information from the contemporary histories of Malchus and Candidus.   His descendants had used every chance and every opportunity to improve their power and after several centuries of watchful grabbing, they had been appointed to the dignity of Elector, the name given to those sovereign princes who were supposed to elect the Emperors of the old German Empire.   He seized, with the ready penetration of a statesman, this trifling incident, which chance had offered to superstition; and exclaimed, in a loud and cheerful tone, that such a domestic bird, so constantly attached to human society, would never have abandoned her ancient seats, unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and solitude.  But Lyman very politely protested, addressing his father punctiliously as Mr. Chairman, and the other ranchers as Gentlemen of the Executive Committee of the League.   It was upon this occasion that Roland, the great Margrave of Breton, showed what a Frankish chieftain of those early days meant when he promised to be faithful to his King, and gave his life and that of his trusted followers to safeguard the retreat of the royal army.   He was not right in his mind.   He presumed to quote the declaration of Christ, that his kingdom is not of this world: he boldly maintained, that the sword and the sceptre were intrusted to the civil magistrate; that temporal honors and possessions were lawfully vested in secular persons; that the abbots, the bishops, and the pope himself, must renounce either their state or their salvation; and that after the loss of their revenues, the voluntary tithes and oblations of the faithful would suffice, not indeed for luxury and avarice, but for a frugal life in the exercise of spiritual labors.   As he affected to hesitate, With this sword, said his companion Michael, I will open the gates of Constantinople to your Imperial sway; or instantly plunge it into your bosom, if you obstinately resist the just desires of your fellow-soldiers.   He cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his sovereign; humbly declares, that prayers and entreaties are his only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy.   He announced that certain resolutions were to be drawn up.  CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
