The scary part about liver disease is how quietly it creeps up on you…

In fact, the Mayo Clinic estimates that 80 to 100 million Americans suffer from this new “modern liver damage.”

And most of us don’t even know it...

Luckily, NEW scientific research shows you can spot it before it destroys your health.

There are 5 early signals of liver trouble that are easy to spot; IF you know what to look for…

Honestly… these are sorta weird.

You’d never guess these can be disease indicators.

Spotting just ONE of these 5 weird liver warnings can literally save your life, preventing diabetes, Alzheimer's and even cancer.

Don’t fall victim to liver disease. Especially when it’s so easy to prevent.

The most common uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim to correct a pathological condition. For instance, aspirin is a widely used drug that acts as a suicide inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase enzyme.[100] This inhibition in turn suppresses the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins and thus aspirin may be used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation.[100] As of 2017, an estimated 29% of approved drugs are enzyme inhibitors[101] of which approximately one-fifth are kinase inhibitors.[101] A notable class of kinase drug targets is the receptor tyrosine kinases which are essential enzymes that regulate cell growth; their over-activation may result in cancer. Hence kinase inhibitors such as imatinib are frequently used to treat malignancies.[102] Janus kinases are another notable example of drug enzyme targets. Inhibitors of Janus kinases block the production of inflammatory cytokines and hence these inhibitors are used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases in including arthritis, asthma, and Crohn's disease.[103] An example of the structural similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target is seen in the figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is the oxidised form of the substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts thymidine bio
