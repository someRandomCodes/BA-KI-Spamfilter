<p>mercy &quot; However, there was a delay. A little crowd formed around the musicians&#39; platform; voices were raised; there was a commotion. Skeezicks, who played the big horn, accused the cornet and the snare a pretty girl certainly, always trailing a group of men behind her. Her love affairs were the talk of all Los Muertos. &quot;I hope that Hooven girl won&#39;t go to the bad,&quot; Presley said to Harran. &quot;Oh, she&#39;s all right,&quot; the other answered. &quot;There&#39;s nothing vicious about Minna, and I guess she&#39;ll marry that foreman on the ditch gang, right enough.&quot; &quot;Well, as a matter of course, she&#39;s a good girl,&quot; Presley hastened to reply, &quot;only she&#39;s too pretty for a poor girl, and too sure of her prettiness besides. That&#39;s the kind,&quot; he continued, &quot;who would find it pretty easy to go wrong if they lived in a city.&quot; Around Caraher&#39;s was a veritable throng. Saddle horses and buggies by the score were clustered underneath the shed or hitched to the railings in front of the watering trough. Three of Broderson&#39;s Portuguese tenants and a couple of workmen from the railroad shops in Bonneville were on the porch, already very drunk. Continually, young men, singly or in groups, came from the door minded, must have its vent in tears; and she burst into an agony of weeping. The sound of those sobs was more than the generous &ldquo;Yes; such doomed mortals, alas if he could die that moment, how gladly would he release himself from an existence fraught with so much misery; but death was not yet within the reach of him who bore the doom of a Wehr Oh end; or, as was generally my way, a solitary walk fore and aft, in the weather waist, between the windlass for when Jeremiah cried out aloud, how very angry God was at them, because of their transgressions, and told them they should be taken prisoners, unless they would surrender up their city, neither did the king nor the people put him to death; but for you, (to pass over what you have done within the city, which I am not able to describe as your wickedness deserves,) you abuse me, and throw darts at me, who only exhort you to save yourselves, as being provoked when you are put in mind of your sins, and cannot bear the very mention of those crimes which you every day perpetrate. For another example, when Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, lay before this city, and had been guilty of many indignities against God, and our forefathers met him in arms, they then were slain in the battle, this city was plundered by our enemies, and our sanctuary made desolate for three years and six months. And what need I bring any more examples dress, and soiled leather leggins, appeared to me to be speaking elegant Spanish. It was a pleasure, simply to listen to the sound of the language, before I could attach any meaning to it. They have a good deal of the Creole drawl, but it is varied with an occasional extreme rapidity of utterance, in which they seem to skip from consonant to consonant, until, lighting upon a broad, open vowel, they rest upon that to restore the balance of sound. The women carry this peculiarity of speaking to a much greater extreme than the men, who have more evenness and stateliness of utterance. A common bullock looking characters&quot; in the smoking &rdquo; said Nisida, in a thick, hoarse, and strangely altered voice, &ldquo;for you are beyond the reach of human aid &rdquo; he chuckled fearfully to himself, as he now paced the room with a lighter step&mdash;as if joy filled his heart; &ldquo;all those who have injured me are within the reach of my vengeance. The Jew in the inquisition; the marquis open to a charge of diabolical sacrilege&mdash;and Giulia assuredly in Florence chamber: and with this last outburst of mortal agony, the spirit of the guilty Giulia fled forever signor, you are mistaken&mdash;you know not the old man whom I deserted, and who was a shepherd on the verge of the Black Forest &rdquo; exclaimed Francisco. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he added, perceiving that the physician was somewhat astonished at the enthusiasm with which he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;at least, such is my firm impression; such, too, is the opinion of my sister.&rdquo; &ldquo;The motive which brought me hither this morning,&rdquo; said Dr. Duras, &ldquo;was to offer you a little friendly advice, which my long acquaintance with your family, my dear count, will prevent you from taking amiss.&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak, doctor&mdash;speak your thoughts all grated sharply on the gravel of the driveway in front of the ranch house, then, with a hollow roll across a little plank bridge, gained the roadway. For a moment the beat of the horses&#39; hoofs made itself heard on the roadway. It ceased. Suddenly there was a great silence. Annixter, in the doorway of the great barn, stood looking about him for a moment, alone, thoughtful. The barn was empty. That astonishing evening had come to an end. The whirl of things and people, the crowd of dancers, Delaney, the gun fight, Hilma Tree, her eyes fixed on him in mute confession, the rabble in the harness room, the news of the regrade, the fierce outburst of wrath, the hasty organising of the League, all went spinning confusedly through his recollection. But he was exhausted. Time enough in the morning to think it all over. By now it was raining sharply. He put the roll of names into his inside pocket, threw a sack over his head and shoulders, and went down to the ranch house. But in the harness room, lighted by the glittering lanterns and flaring lamps, in the midst of overturned chairs, spilled liquor, cigar stumps, and broken glasses, Vanamee and Presley still remained talking, talking. At length, they rose, and came out upon the floor of the barn and stood for a moment looking about them. Billy, the stableman, was going the rounds of the walls, putting out light after light. By degrees, the vast interior was growing dim. Upon the roof overhead the rain drummed incessantly, the eaves dripping. The floor was littered with pine needles, bits of orange peel, ends and fragments of torn organdies and muslins and bits of tissue paper from the &quot;Phrygian Bonnets&quot; and &quot;Liberty Caps.&quot; The buckskin mare in the stall, dozing on three legs, changed position with a long sigh. The sweat stiffening the hair upon her back and loins, as it dried, gave off a penetrating, ammoniacal odour that mingled with the stale perfume of sachet and wilted flowers. Presley and Vanamee stood looking at the deserted barn. There was a long silence. Then Presley said: &quot;Well ... what do you think of it all buried in the water, and this, not because she was thirsty, but because it was a new way to drink. She imagined herself a belated traveller, a poor girl, an outcast, quenching her thirst at the wayside brook, her little packet of cresses doing duty for a bundle of clothes. Night was coming on. Perhaps it would storm. She had nowhere to go. She would apply at a hut for shelter. Abruptly, the temptation to dabble her feet in the creek presented itself to her. Always she had liked to play in the water. What a delight now to take off her shoes and stockings and wade out into the shallows near the bank &rdquo; demanded Wagner. &ldquo;Are not the sufferings which I have just endured, enough to satisfy thy hatred of all human beings water fountain; &quot;I know a little tad that would just about jump out of her skin for that. Think I&#39;ll have to take it with me.&quot; &quot;How&#39;s Sidney getting along &quot; &quot;Pshaw sails set, and every prospect of a speedy and pleasant passage round. CHAPTER V CAPE HORN European Greeks, who become the teachers of another Indo in raising thee to thy present high state. But the bounties of the sultan are without end, as the mercy of Allah is illimitable mentioned night, and the domestics, yielding to the influence of a soporific which Antonio, the faithless valet, had infused into the wine which it was his province to deal out to them under the superintendence of the head butler, had also withdrawn to their respective chambers. Nisida had dismissed her maids shortly before eleven, but she did not seek her couch. There was an expression of wild determination, of firm resolve, in her dark black eyes and her compressed lips which denoted the courage of her dauntless but impetuous mind. For of that mind the large piercing eyes seemed an exact transcript. Terrible was she in the decision of her masculine&mdash;oh ache, and this cold weather, and wetting and freezing, were not the best things in the world for it. I soon found that it was getting strong hold, and running over all parts of my face; and before the watch was out I went aft to the mate, who had charge of the medicine hod and a box of iron bolts and nuts. On the wall over the bed, in a gilt frame, was Annixter&#39;s college diploma, while on the bureau, amid a litter of hair &quot; Annixter put the claw of the hammer underneath the edge of the board top and wrenched with all his might. The boards had been clamped together by a transverse bar and the whole top of the box came away in one piece. A layer of excelsior was disclosed, and on it a letter addressed by typewriter to Annixter. It bore the trade I kept dark curious, because it&#39;s a new, safe, and highly ingenious method of bribery. How did you happen to think of it, Governor master, and quarter morrow is the feast of The Holy Cross, and I am preparing against it. The night is fine. We will smoke a cigar in the cloister garden.&quot; A few moments later the two passed out of the door on the other side of the church, opposite the pulpit, Sarria adjusting a silk skull cap on his tonsured head. He wore his cassock now, and was far more the churchman in appearance than when Vanamee and Presley had seen him on a former occasion. They were now in the cloister garden. The place was charming. Everywhere grew clumps of palms and magnolia trees. A grapevine, over a century old, occupied a trellis in one angle of the walls which surrounded the garden on two sides. Along the third side was the church itself, while the fourth was open, the wall having crumbled away, its site marked only by a line of eight great pear trees, older even than the grapevine, gnarled, twisted, bearing no fruit. Directly opposite the pear trees, in the south wall of the garden, was a round, arched portal, whose gate giving upon the esplanade in front of the Mission was always closed. Small gravelled walks, well kept, bordered with mignonette, twisted about among the flower beds, and underneath the magnolia trees. In the centre was a little fountain in a stone basin green with moss, while just beyond, between the fountain and the pear trees, stood what was left of a sun dial, the bronze gnomon, green with the beatings of the weather, the figures on the half &quot; said they, as soon as they saw us; and we went down, and found a large, high forecastle, well lighted; and a crew of twelve or fourteen men, eating out of their kids and pans, and drinking their tea, and talking and laughing, all as independent and easy as so many &quot;wood maid and the blue painted foothills. He was suddenly aware of Cedarquist&#39;s voice in his ear, and, turning about, found himself face to face with the manufacturer, his wife and his two daughters. There was a meeting. Salutations were exchanged, Presley shaking hands all around, expressing his delight at seeing his old friends once more, for he had known the family from his boyhood, Mrs. Cedarquist being his aunt. Mrs. Cedarquist and her two daughters declared that the air of Los Muertos must certainly have done him a world of good. He was stouter, there could be no doubt of it. A little pale, perhaps. He was fatiguing himself with his writing, no doubt. Ah, he must take care. Health was everything, after all. Had he been writing any more verse &quot; and the captain came up, on hearing the song, and said to the passenger, within hearing of the man at the wheel, child as yet, but tall as a man for all that. There was a moment&#39;s awkward silence, then Hilma explained: &quot;I the one that Mr. Derrick owns.&quot; The speaker had no more than regained his seat when a man was seen pushing his way from the back of the stage towards Garnett. He handed the rancher a note, at the same time whispering in his ear. Garnett read the note, then came forward to the edge of the stage, holding up his hand. When the audience had fallen silent he said: &quot;I have just received sad news. Our friend and fellow Oh hall. Some of the Pilgrim&#39;s crew were in the forecastle, and we all turned down, we found a Chilian man way to the mission. Here was as peculiar a sight as we had seen before in the house; the one looking as much like a funeral procession as the other did like a house of mourning. The little coffin was borne by eight girls, who were continually relieved by others, running forward from the procession and taking their places. Behind it came a straggling company of girls, dressed as before, in white and flowers, and including, I should suppose by their numbers, nearly all the girls between five and fifteen in the place. They played along on the way, frequently stopping and running all together to talk to some one, or to pick up a flower, and then running on again to overtake the coffin. There were a few elderly women in common colors; and a herd of young men and boys, some on foot and others mounted, followed them, or walked or rode by their side, frequently interrupting them by jokes and questions. But the most singular thing of all was, that two men walked, one on each side of the coffin, carrying muskets in their hands, which they continually loaded, and fired into the air. Whether this was to keep off the evil spirits or not, I do not know. It was the only interpretation that I could put upon it. As we drew near the mission, we saw the great gate thrown open, and the p&aacute;dre standing on the steps, with a crucifix in hand. The mission is a large and deserted No, no: and we can return together to my native city, we can enter Florence in triumph, thou no longer fearing the terror of the law, I no longer compelled to simulate the doom of the deaf and dumb seven yahr. Do I alzoh crossed and crossed again. There is but one goal to the via dolorosa; there is no escape from the central chamber of that labyrinth. Fate guides the feet of them that are set therein. Double on their steps though they may, weave in and out of the myriad corners of the city&#39;s streets, return, go forward, back, from side to side, here, there, anywhere, dodge, twist, wind, the central chamber where Death sits is reached inexorably at the end. Sometimes leading and sometimes carrying Hilda, Mrs. Hooven set off upon her objectless journey. Block after block she walked, street after street. She was afraid to stop, because of the policemen. As often as she so much as slackened her pace, she was sure to see one of these terrible figures in the distance, watching her, so it seemed to her, waiting for her to halt for the fraction of a second, in order that he might have an excuse to arrest her. Hilda fretted incessantly. &quot;Mammy, where&#39;re we gowun until the noon of the next day O insensible creatures, and more stupid than are the stones themselves &quot; shouted a man, throwing back the slide of the scuttle, to the watch below, who were soon out of their berths and on deck; and &quot;Sail ho men came with a sad countenance to the king, and told him that his brother had been destroyed by poison, and that his wife had brought him somewhat that was prepared after an unusual manner, and that, upon his eating it, he presently fell into his distemper; that Antipater&#39;s mother and sister, two days before, brought a woman out of Arabia that was skillful in mixing such drugs, that she might prepare a love potion for Pheroras; and that instead of a love potion, she had given him deadly poison; and that this was done by the management of Sylleus, who was acquainted with that woman. 2. The king was deeply affected with so many suspicions, and had the maid Puncher. But the sheriff was already out of the saddle and into the telegraph office. &quot;There&#39;s a derailing switch between here and Pixley, isn&#39;t there the remembrance of the forecastle dinners I ate here twenty plate dance when his broncho man Were I the proudest peer in Christendom, I would sacrifice every consideration of rank and family for your sake. What more can man say &rdquo; And Nisida replied through the same medium, &ldquo;Your happiness, dearest brother, has ever been my only study, and shall continue so.&rdquo; The physician and Father Marco, the priest, now advanced, and taking the brother and sister by the hands, led them from the chamber of death. &ldquo;Kind friends,&rdquo; said Francisco, now Count of Riverola, &ldquo;I understand you. You would withdraw my sister and myself from a scene too mournful to contemplate. Alas house just now to view the body of a young lady, unclaimed as yet, who had her head nearly severed from her trunk last night; and then I proceeded to the great square to see whether any executions are to take place to war&#39;s xxiii.

The night was dreadful; Hilda sobbed herself to sleep on her mother&#39;s shoulder, waking thereafter from hour to hour, to protest, though wrapped in her mother&#39;s shawl, that she was cold, and to enquire why they did not go to bed. Drunken men snored and sprawled near at hand. Towards morning, a loafer, reeking of alcohol, sat down beside her, and indulged in an incoherent soliloquy, punctuated with oaths and obscenities. It was not till far along towards daylight that she fell asleep. She awoke to find it broad day.

Hark, there is an ominous rustling in one of the trees of the forest; and the monster seems to instinctively know the danger which menaces it. But still its course is not changed;&mdash;it seems not to exercise its own will in shaping its course. Down the tremendous snake flings itself from the tree&mdash;and in an instant its hideous coils are wound round the foaming, steaming, palpitating body of the wolf. The air is rent with the yell of agony that bursts from the throat of the horrified monster as it tumbles over and over, as if it had run to the length of a tether&mdash;for the snake clings with its tail to the bough from which it has darted down. But the yielding of the wolf is only momentary; up&mdash;up it springs again&mdash;and away,&mdash;away it careers, more madly, more desperately, more ferociously, if possible, than before.

Its volume was the index of failure or success, of riches or poverty. And at this point, the labour of the rancher ended. Here, at the lip of the chute, he parted company with his grain, and from here the wheat streamed forth to feed the world. The yawning mouths of the sacks might well stand for the unnumbered mouths of the People, all agape for food; and here, into these sacks, at first so lean. so flaccid, attenuated like starved stomachs, rushed the living stream of food, insistent, interminable, filling the empty, fattening the shrivelled, making it sleek and heavy and solid. Half an hour later, the harvester stopped again. The men on the sacking platform had used up all the sacks. But S. Behrman&#39;s foreman, a new man on Los Muertos, put in an appearance with the report that the wagon bringing a fresh supply was approaching. &quot;How is the grain elevator at Port Costa getting on, sir &rdquo; demanded the lieutenant. &ldquo;Yes, yes; and his lordship is a worthy man&mdash;an estimable man. No oppressor of the poor defenseless Jew is he Gaul And Spain Are Occupied By The Barbarians. But never a night had been so beautiful as this. It was the full period of the spring. The air was a veritable caress. The infinite repose of the little garden, sleeping under the night, was delicious beyond expression. It was a tiny corner of the world, shut off, discreet, distilling romance, a garden of dreams, of enchantments. Below, in the little valley, the resplendent colourations of the million flowers, roses, lilies, hyacinths, carnations, violets, glowed like incandescence in the golden light of the rising moon. The air was thick with the perfume, heavy with it, clogged with it. The sweetness filled the very mouth. The throat choked with it. Overhead wheeled the illimitable procession of the constellations. Underfoot, the earth was asleep. The very flowers were dreaming. A cathedral hush overlay all the land, and a sense of benediction brooded low, arm, pass the earing, and sing out &quot;Haul out to leeward &rdquo; was the general question. &ldquo;That they kill Christian children to mix the blood in the dough with which they make the bread used at their religious ceremonies,&rdquo; answered the sbirro. &ldquo;Depend upon it.
