The game's variety and replay value received mixed reactions. IGN's reviewer commented positively on the replayability, finding that the game provided a deeper experience on each subsequent playthrough.[6] GameSpot was less positive, writing that while some events and locations were not guaranteed on each generated island, later portions of the game were less interesting due to their familiarity.[4] Likewise, PC Gamer said that towards the end of the game they began to find it aimless and unstimulating, in particular because of the sparsity of animal life.[37] The PlayStation Vita version received "generally favourable reviews", while the PlayStation 3 version received above-average reviews, according to Metacritic.[29][30] Pocket Gamer gave a positive review, praising the audio and the extra features present in the Vita version such as PlayStation Trophies, which provided a reason to replay the game. They noted, however, that the game had some performance issues, particularly when moving the camera.[26] Metro's review described the game as a "fascinating interactive experience", particularly as a result of the music.[52] PlayStation Official Magazine – UK called the PlayStation 3 version "simple but wonderfully effective", commenting positively on the game's uniqueness and sense of wonder.[36] Many players and journalists debated Proteus' status as a video game, citing aspects such as the lack of goals or objectives.[53][54][55] Some, including the game's developers, called it an anti-game, a description which was controversial.[56][57] Ian Bogost proposed that the game was intentionally unconventional, arguing that "Proteus is a game about being an island instead of a game about being on one".[58] IGN argued that Proteus does contain an action (walking) and a goal (proceeding through the seasons).[6] Edge's reviewer contended that the day/night cycle, changeable weather, and a player-triggered change of seasons qualified Proteus as a legitimate game.[34] Key responded by pointing out that, while the product does include rudimentary game mechanics, interacting with them is optional and they do not usually provide feedback. However, Key went on to argue that "encouraging a strict definition of 'game' does nothing but foster conservatism and defensiven
