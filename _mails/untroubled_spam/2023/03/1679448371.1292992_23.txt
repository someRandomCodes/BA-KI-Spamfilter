Scientists called this “the craziest tinnitus experiment ever”.

Yet, as weird as it might sound, it showed without a trace of a doubt that the tongue is the key to silencing ear ringing permanently.

No less than 326 patients who took part in this trial are living proof of that.

Here’s what they had to do with their tongue every morning.

Warning: it’s odd, but more and more people are now using this method daily and many of them claim they’ve finally found peace and quiet.

Try and see for yourself!

Scientists Shocked: Tinnitus Comes from Your Tongue







 
fter his service at UMass Amherst and a visiting professorship at the University of Connecticut, Achebe returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976, where he held a chair in English until his retirement in 1981.[108] When he returned to the University of Nigeria, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of Okike, and further his study of Igbo culture. In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, stating that the archetype was divorced from the intellect "but for two things: status and stomach. And if there's any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job, he would prefer to turn a blind eye to what is happening around him."[109] In October 1979, Achebe was awarded the first-ever Nigerian National Merit Award.[110] After his 1981 retirement,[108] he devoted more time to editing Okike and became active with the left-leaning People's Redemption Party (PRP). In 1983, he became the party's deputy national vice-president. He published a book called The Trouble with Nigeria to coincide with the upcoming elections. On the first page, Achebe says: "the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership."[111] The elections that followed were marked by violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since A Man of the People, Achebe replied: "I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated."[112] After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument—which almost became a fistfight—with Sabo Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and kept his distance from political parties, expressing sadness with his perception of the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.[113] He spent most of the 1980s delivering speeches, attending conferences, and working on his sixth novel.[114] In 1986 he was elected president-general of the Ogidi Town Union; he reluctantly accepted and began a three-year
