Dear Beneficiary,

This is to notify you that, after a meeting with the delegates of the payment committee here in the United States, it has been officially approved that your payment sum of US$5,610,000 be remitted to you through bank transfer.

You will have an account set up in your favor at the bank, which you will access through the bank's online platform. You will then be able to transfer funds from your bank account to any of your designated bank accounts.

Kindly get back to me so that this favorable development can be processed in your favor.

Best regards,
Paul M. Abbate
