Hi,<br /><br />Here is our new electric bicycle With removable 374.4Wh
battery, you can pedal assist to 40 miles per charge using the low pedal
assist level. <br />350w brushless geared motor provides reliable support
and 20MPH top speed. providing more than enough to power your daily
commute, <br />a cruise on the mountain, or a meander along your favorite
trail. <br /> You can easily handle most of the hillsides encountered.<br
/> <br /> We provide four levels for power assistance. You can choose to
turn the thumb throttle or step on the pedal to activate the motor. <br
/>You can switch between pedal assist and thumb throttle at any time. The
four-levels power output is sufficient to meet your daily <br />commuting
needs and outdoor climbing needs. You can add a burst of speed with the
throttle, which is ideal for pulling away from traffic lights.<br /> <br />
The fork is made of high strength carbon steel and the frame is made from
aluminum alloy. This makes the bike lightweight yet very sturdy. <br />With
the 21-speed transmission system, you can choose any speed according to
your needs. The perfect front and rear disc brakes fully protect your

electrical accessories. If you need to replace the parts, you can replace
it directly at the connector <br />without opening the controller to find a
complicated circuit. After-sales replacement of accessories is much more
convenient.<br /> <br /> Our bike is 85% pre-assembled and you only need to
finish the assembly of main parts. we also have the assembly video for you
