Intense Tropical Cyclone Dumazile was a strong tropical cyclone that brought flooding to Madagascar and Réunion in early March 2018. Dumazile originated from an area of low pressure that formed in the South-West Indian Ocean near Agaléga on 27 February. The system concentrated into a tropical disturbance on 2 March and was named the next day, as it intensified into a tropical storm. Amid conditions conducive for intensification, Dumazile strengthened over the next two days and reached peak intensity on 5 March as an intense tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), and a central pressure of 945 hPa (27.91 inHg). The system weakened steadily over the next couple days because of increasing wind shear as it tracked to the southeast. Dumazile became post-tropical on 7 March and eventually dissipated completely on 10 March near the Kerguelen Islands. Cyclone Dumazile affected Réunion less than two months after Cyclone Berguitta, halting ongoing repairs to bridges and reconstruction efforts. Torrential rainfall, reaching 1,600 mm (63 in) in Salazie, caused significant flooding across the island. Floodwaters, landslides, and downed trees caused significant damage and disruption to the road network on Réunion, particularly in coastal and mountainous areas. Repairs to the highway between Îlet Furçy and Cilaos were set back significantly. Large waves along the coast caused erosion, leading to collapses of beachfront infrastructure and beach closures. Ports were also damaged by the waves, and the Port of Saint-Gilles was clogged by debris. The agricultural sector incurred about €3 million (US$3.73 million; equivalent to $4.03 million in 2021) of damage, as crops were destroyed by floods and gusty winds. Recovery in Réunion was later hampered further by Cyclone Fakir in April. The northern and eastern coasts of Madagascar experienced about 210 mm (8.3 in) of rain. Flooding occurred in Toamasina as a result of malfunctioning drainage systems which had been damaged by Cyclone Ava in January. Parts of the city lost power during the stor
