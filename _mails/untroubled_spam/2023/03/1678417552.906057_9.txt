<div id="output">NEWS FROM HOME if the right wins out in the end, that&#39;s the main thing. We want you in this thing, and we want you bad. You&#39;ve been chewing on this affair now a long time. Have you made up your mind topmast staysail, which were made on the coast, and never had been used, were bent, with a complete set of new earings, robands and reef working ALL his land cracked mud. Presley climbed to the summit of one of the hills pst &rdquo; &ldquo;Thou, thou, Nisida grounds in the whole western coast of America, all fit it for a place of great importance; and, indeed, it has attracted much attention, for the settlement of &quot;Yerba Buena,&quot; where we lay at anchor, made chiefly by Americans and English, and which bids fair to become the most important trading place on the coast, at this time began to supply traders, Russian ships, and whalers, with their stores of wheat and frijoles. The tide leaving us, we came to anchor near the mouth of the bay, under a high and beautifully sloping hill, upon which herds of hundreds and hundreds of red deer, and the stag, with his high branching antlers, were bounding about, looking at us for a moment, and then starting off, affrighted at the noises which we made for the purpose of seeing the variety of their beautiful attitudes and motions. At midnight, the tide having turned, we hove up our anchor and stood out of the bay, with a fine starry heaven above us, What the whole must be dropped again. When all was right, the bunts were triced well up, the yard water port, where the grain ships for Liverpool and the East took on their cargoes. To this end, he had bought and greatly enlarged a building at Port Costa, that was already in use for that purpose, and to this elevator all the crop of Los Muertos was to be carried. The P. and S. W. made S. Behrman a special rate. &quot;By the way,&quot; said S. Behrman to his superintendent, &quot;we&#39;re in luck. Fallon&#39;s buyer was in Bonneville yesterday. He&#39;s buying for Fallon and for Holt, too. I happened to run into him, and I&#39;ve sold a ship load.&quot; &quot;A ship load zum, goo The means They can&#39;t get at you through the courts, wells, for greater supplies of wheat and grain. The purely political events of the European continent dwindled to mere insignificance in the eyes of men who were making plans for steamboat lines on Victoria Nyanza or for railroads through the interior of Shantung. They knew that many European questions still remained to be settled, but they did not bother, and through sheer indifference and carelessness they bestowed upon their descendants a terrible inheritance of hate and misery. For untold centuries the south dressed little woman of some fifty years. She was rich in her own name, even before her marriage, being a relative of Shelgrim himself and on familiar terms with the great financier and his family. Her husband, while deploring the policy of the railroad, saw no good reason for quarrelling with Shelgrim, and on more than one occasion had dined at his house. On this occasion, delighted that she had come upon a &quot;minor poet,&quot; she insisted upon presenting him to Hartrath. &quot;You two should have so much in common,&quot; she explained. Presley shook the flaccid hand of the artist, murmuring conventionalities, while Mrs. Cedarquist hastened to say: &quot;I am sure you know Mr. Presley&#39;s verse, Mr. Hartrath. You should, believe me. You two have much in common. I can see so much that is alike in your modes of interpreting nature. In Mr. Presley&#39;s sonnet, &#39;The Better Part,&#39; there is the same note as in your picture, the same sincerity of tone, the same subtlety of touch, the same nuances, &quot; &quot;No,&quot; answered S. Behrman, &quot;I want you to stop down here, and see that those carpenters hustle the work in the ranch house. Derrick will be out by then. You see this deal is peculiar. I&#39;m not selling to any middle construct that early west or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and your life devotion was sure to entail upon me. I knew that I must exercise the most stern&mdash;the most remorseless&mdash;the most inflexible despotism over my emotions&mdash;that I must crush as it were the very feelings of my soul&mdash;that I must also observe a caution so unwearied and so constantly wakeful, that it would amount to a sensitiveness the most painful&mdash;and that I must prepare myself to hear the merry jest without daring to smile, or the exciting narrative of the world&rsquo;s stirring events without suffering my countenance to vary a hue press and letter &rdquo; continued she, in the rapid, low, and yet distinctly audible whisper, &ldquo;for your sake&mdash;for mine, betray me not but Gibbon can scarcely have intended such a phrase. Phelps is ready and waiting.&quot; Annixter struck his heel into the ground with a suppressed oath. Always these fool feemale women came between him and his plans, mixing themselves up in his affairs. Magnus had been on the very point of saying something, perhaps committing himself to some course of action, and, at precisely the wrong moment, his wife had cut in. The opportunity was lost. The three returned toward the ranch house; but before saying good &rdquo; ejaculated the young man. &ldquo;Oh, yes, my dear father &quot; The flogging was seldom if ever alluded to by us, in the forecastle. If any one was inclined to talk about it, the others, with a delicacy which I hardly expected to find among them, always stopped him, or turned the subject. But the behavior of the two men who were flogged toward one another showed a delicacy and a sense of honor, which would have been worthy of admiration in the highest walks of life. Sam knew that the other had suffered solely on his account, and in all his complaints, he said that if he alone had been flogged, it would have been nothing; but that he never could see that man without thinking what had been the means of bringing that disgrace upon him; and John never, by word or deed, let anything escape him to remind the other that it was by interfering to save his shipmate, that he had suffered. Having got all our spare room filled with hides, we hove up our anchor and made sail for San Diego. In no operation can the disposition of a crew be discovered better than in getting under weigh. Where things are &quot;done with a will,&quot; every one is like a cat aloft: sails are loosed in an instant; each one lays out his strength on his handspike, and the windlass goes briskly round with the loud cry of &quot;Yo heave ho two For what fate am I destined Moreover, do the Arabians and Syrians now first of all begin to govern themselves as they please, and to indulge their appetites in a foreign war, and then, out of their barbarity in murdering men, and out of their hatred to the Jews, get it ascribed to the Romans &quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Annixter got up, cast away his cigar, and dropping the buckskin&#39;s bridle, came and stood beside her, putting a hand on her shoulder. Hilma did not move, and he felt her trembling. She still plucked at the knot of the handkerchief. &quot;I can&#39;t do without you, little girl,&quot; Annixter continued, &quot;and I want you. I want you bad. I don&#39;t get much fun out of life ever. It, sure, isn&#39;t my nature, I guess. I&#39;m a hard man. Everybody is trying to down me, and now I&#39;m up against the Railroad. I&#39;m fighting &#39;em all, Hilma, night and day, lock, stock, and barrel, and I&#39;m fighting now for my home, my land, everything I have in the world. If I win out, I want somebody to be glad with me. If I don&#39;t wicked&mdash;worldly witnesses of, perhaps sufferers in, the horrible atrocities committed on the capture of the city &quot; &quot;No, no, no,&quot; she cried; &quot;it was he who blundered. YOU blundering in a social amenity &quot; Hilma beat a tattoo with her heels upon the floor, shutting her fists, the thumbs tucked inside. She closed her eyes, shaking her head energetically. &quot;I won&#39;t listen, I won&#39;t listen, I won&#39;t listen,&quot; she cried. &quot;But, just the same association quite easily developed into an organised state. Then one man grew more powerful than most of his neighbours and he became the leader of the community and their commander given explanations were exchanged between them, by means of the language of the fingers,&mdash;Francisco satisfying Nisida&rsquo;s anxiety in respect to the success of her project, by which the total extermination of the banditti had been effected,&mdash;and she conveying to him as much of the outline of her adventures during the last seven months as she thought it prudent to impart. They then separated, it being now very late; and, moreover, Nisida had still some work in hand for that night. The moment Francisco was alone, he exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;Oh the eyes of a young girl breeze sprang up, which carried us well along; and at four o&#39;clock, thinking ourselves to the northward of Race Point, we hauled upon the wind and stood into the bay, west the new press. You remember I asked for one last month Was the fleet, which he had seen on the previous day, still off the island Not as one grain, but as twenty. So all life. Death is only real for all the detritus of the world, for all the sorrow, for all the injustice, for all the grief. Presley, the good never dies; evil dies, cruelty, oppression, selfishness, greed head and work down, tarring the shrouds, back to, at all hours of the night and day, and a constant look persecuted race, the Jews&mdash;a race endowed with many virtues and generous qualities, but whose characters have been blackened by a host of writers whose narrow minds and illiberal prejudices have induced them to preserve all the exaggerations and misrepresentations which tradition hands down in the Christian world relative to the cruelly no, she felt certain that he would leave no measure untried to discover her fate, no means unessayed to effect her deliverance. But, alas &quot; morrow must witness a renewal of that scene which occurred this evening, I shall succumb&mdash;I shall yield; in a moment of despair I shall exclaim, &lsquo;Yes, Nisida&mdash;I will sacrifice everything to acquire the power to transport thee back to Italy;&rsquo;&mdash;and I shall hurry to yon mountains, and seeking their wildest defile, shall evoke the enemy of mankind, and say, &lsquo;Come, Satan, I give thee my soul in exchange for the illimitable power thou offerest.&rsquo; And thus will be the terrible result&mdash;the fearful catastrophe.&rdquo; Big drops of agony stood upon Fernand&rsquo;s brow as he uttered these words. He saw that he was hovering on the verge of a fearful abyss&mdash;and he trembled lest he should fall, so intense was his love for Nisida. At one moment he thought of the soothing vision, full of hope and promise, which had occupied his slumber in the morning; at another he pondered on the tears, the prayers, and the threats of Nisida. The conflicting thoughts were, indeed, sufficient to urge him on to a state of utter despair:&mdash;his eternal salvation and the happiness of her whom he loved so tenderly were placed in such antagonistic position that they raised a fierce&mdash;a painful&mdash;an agonizing warfare in his breast. Now he would fall upon his knees and pray&mdash;and pray fervently for strength to continue in the right path: then he would again give way to all the maddening influences of his bitter reflections; and, while in this mood, had Satan suddenly stood before him, he would have succumbed&mdash;yes, he would have succumbed. But the fiend had no longer any power to offer direct temptation to the wretched Wagner. Oh we procured two, at four reals apiece, with an Indian boy to run on behind and bring them back. Determined to have &quot;the go&quot; out of the horses, for our trouble, we went down at full speed, and were on the beach in fifteen minutes. Wishing to make our liberty last as long as possible, we rode up and down among the hide captain Stephano to the vicinity of his mansion. All this looks black enough, and it is more than probable that Wagner was in league with the redoubtable Stephano and his banditti. Then the mysterious disappearance of Flora is, to say the least, alarming, for I believe she was a well conducted, virtuous, estimable young woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;She was&mdash;she was indeed Well the lee brace; haul taught to windward&quot; When man, having yielded to temptation, succeeds in escaping the perils of the consequences, he beholds a strong motive for self I&#39;ll give you the key.&quot; He &quot;fanned&quot; his revolver, spinning it about his index finger by the trigger I can hear them yet. Every shot seemed like the explosion of tons of powder.&quot; &quot;Shall we clear out, then &quot;put her two arms around me,&quot; prompted Annixter, half smiling, &quot;like spring of his life. The thought of self, the worship of that capital letter ``N&#39;&#39; with which he signed all his letters, and which recurred forever in the ornaments of his hastily constructed palaces, the absolute will to make the name Napoleon the most important thing in the world next to the name of God, these desires carried Napoleon to a pinnacle of fame which no other man has ever reached. When he was a half perish in the ruins of the convent &quot;Sail ho will to him; for he was a shrewd man to entice men to him, both by deluding them and putting cheats upon them. Nay, many there were that thought they should be safer themselves, if the causes of their past insolent actions should now be reduced to one head, and not to a great many. His activity was so great, and that both in action and in counsel, that he had not a few guards about him; yet was there a great party of his antagonists that left him; among whom envy at him weighed a great deal, while they thought it a very heavy thing to be in subjection to one that was formerly their equal. But the main reason that moved men against him was the dread of monarchy, for they could not hope easily to put an end to his power, if he had once obtained it; and yet they knew that he would have this pretense always against them, that they had opposed him when he was first advanced; while every one chose rather to suffer any thing whatsoever in war, than that, when they had been in a voluntary slavery for some time, they should afterward perish. So the sedition was divided into two parts, and John reigned in opposition to his adversaries over one of them: but for their leaders, they watched one another, nor did they at all, or at least very little, meddle with arms in their quarrels; but they fought earnestly against the people, and contended one with another which of them should bring home the greatest prey. But because the city had to struggle with three of the greatest misfortunes, war, and tyranny, and sedition, it appeared, upon the comparison, that the war was the least troublesome to the populace of them all. Accordingly, they ran away from their own houses to foreigners, and obtained that preservation from the Romans which they despaired to obtain among their own people. 2. And now a fourth misfortune arose, in order to bring our nation to destruction. There was a fortress of very great strength not far from Jerusalem, which had been built by our ancient kings, both as a repository for their effects in the hazards of war, and for the preservation of their bodies at the same time. It was called Masada. Those that were called Sicarii had taken possession of it formerly, but at this time they overran the neighboring countries, aiming only to procure to themselves necessaries; for the fear they were then in prevented their further ravages. But when once they were informed that the Roman army lay still, and that the Jews were divided between sedition and tyranny, they boldly undertook greater matters; and at the feast of unleavened bread, which the Jews celebrate in memory of their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, when they were sent back into the country of their forefathers, they came down by night, without being discovered by those that could have prevented them, and overran a certain small city called Engaddi: &quot; &quot;Anything wrong &quot; Magnus rose abruptly to his full height, the nostrils of his thin, hawk careful not to BLOT it, child, the ink&#39;s wet yet h boot Dago.&quot; &quot;You misjudge him. A really good fellow on better acquaintance.&quot; Annixter grunted scornfully. Sarria&#39;s kindness and good Oh night, signor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good driven machines of Daimler and Levassor of the eighties of the last century) can do better than these early ``Puffing Billies.&#39;&#39; But while these practically droghing seemed completely to break down his spirit. I had determined not to go myself, happen what would, and I knew that the captain would not dare to attempt to force me. I knew, too, that the two captains had agreed together to get some one, and that unless I could prevail upon somebody to go voluntarily, there would be no help for Ben. From this consideration, though I had said that I would have nothing to do with an exchange, I did my best to get some one to go voluntarily. I offered to give an order upon the owners in Boston for six months&#39; wages, and also all the clothes, books, and other matters, which I should not want upon the voyage home. When this offer was published in the ship, and the case of poor Ben was set forth in strong colors, several, who would not have dreamed of going themselves, were busy in talking it up to others, who, they thought, might be tempted to accept it; and, at length, one fellow, a harum house was no place to learn seamanship in. I had become experienced in hide in early, knowing that we might expect an early call; and sure enough, before the stars had quite faded, &quot;All hands ahoy sails got ready for the light trades; ring Pasha had risen to the exalted rank of grand vizier, and had married the sister of Solyman the Magnificent. The sultan daily became more attached to him; and he, on his part, acquired influence over his imperial master.
