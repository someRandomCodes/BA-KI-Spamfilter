<div id="output">seated, half No; it were better that she should depart; it were preferable that he should lose her and preserve his immortal soul. Thus reasoned he;&mdash;and that reasoning was effectual. He waited only long enough to assure himself that the fleet was positively approaching the island:&mdash;he then knew that she would depart;&mdash;and, without permitting himself to yield again to the weakness which had for a few moments threatened to send him back within the sphere of Nisida&rsquo;s fatal influence, he tore himself away from that point amongst the heights which commanded the view of the side of the island where she was. Hastening around the base of the volcano, he reached the defiles leading to that part of the isle where he had periodically fulfilled his dreadful destiny as a Wehr west coast of America, five days out. She then filled away and left us to plough on through our waste of waters. This day ended pleasantly; we had got into regular and comfortable weather, and into that routine of sea looked the little valley. But Vanamee&#39;s unhappiness was too keen this night for him to dwell long upon the vagaries of his mind. Submitting at length, and abandoning the grave, he flung himself down in the black shade of the pear trees, his chin in his hands, and resigned himself finally and definitely to the inrush of recollection and the exquisite grief of an infinite regret. To his fancy, she came to him again. He put himself back many years. He remembered the warm nights of July and August, profoundly still, the sky encrusted with stars, the little Mission garden exhaling the mingled perfumes that all through the scorching day had been distilled under the steady blaze of a summer&#39;s sun. He saw himself as another person, arriving at this, their rendezvous. All day long she had been in his mind. All day long he had looked forward to this quiet hour that belonged to her. It was dark. He could see nothing, but, by and by, he heard a step, a gentle rustle of the grass on the slope of the hill pressed under an advancing foot. Then he saw the faint gleam of pallid gold of her hair, a barely visible glow in the starlight, and heard the murmur of her breath in the lapse of the over How dingy were the lilies at her waist, compared with her heaving breast gallant studding &#39;s conduct, since he took command of the ship, was owing, no doubt, in a great measure, to this fact. If the chief officer wants force, discipline slackens, everything gets out of joint, the captain interferes continually; that makes a difficulty between them, which encourages the crew, and the whole ends in a three bursting excitement of a man &quot; &quot;Top call the watch, Spanish gallant masts, and a certain slovenly look to the sails, rigging, spars and hull; and when we got on board, we found everything to correspond, hand, who came in the boat, to me, when I asked him about his captain. He was indeed a singular man. He was six feet high, wore thick, cowhide boots, and brown coat and trowsers, and, except a sun to take me on board the Alert, in case she returned to the United States before the Pilgrim; and I, of course, wished to know whether the order had been received, and what was the destination of the ship. One year more or less might be of small consequence to others, but it was everything to me. It was now just a year since we sailed from Boston, and at the shortest, no vessel could expect to get away under eight or nine months, which would make our absence two years in all. This would be pretty long, but would not be fatal. It would not necessarily be decisive of my future life. But one year more would settle the matter. I should be a sailor for life; and although I had made up my mind to it before I had my letters from home, and was, as I thought, quite satisfied; yet, as soon as an opportunity was held out to me of returning, and the prospect of another kind of life was opened to me, my anxiety to return, and, at least, to have the chance of deciding upon my course for myself, was beyond measure. Beside that, I wished to be &quot;equal to either fortune,&quot; and to qualify myself for an officer&#39;s berth, and a hide &quot; y head, as the last fake of the coil drops from his hand, and &quot;Watch sufficient air with which he had endeavored to deceive the venerable count, whose wife he had dishonored. For dishonor now menaced him the sweets of liberty. My friend S like triumph now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But we are to some extent digressing from the thread of our narrative. Nisida placed the lamp in the chimney, in such a way that its light was concealed so as to leave all the immediate vicinity of the door in a state of complete darkness; and she seated herself in a chair close by, to await the expected events of midnight. Slowly, slowly passed the intervening twenty minutes; and the lady had ample leisure to reflect upon all the incidents of her life&mdash;ay, and to shudder too at one which had dyed her hand with blood&mdash;the blood of Agnes It was under the influence of these excited feelings that the Count of Arestino burst into the room. Fortunately&mdash;so far as outward appearance went&mdash;there was nothing more to confirm the old nobleman&rsquo;s suspicions; the youthful pair were not locked in each other&rsquo;s arms; their hands were not even joined. Manuel was seated on the sofa, and Giulia was standing at a short distance from him. But conscious guilt elicited a faint scream from her lips; and the boiling blood, after rushing to her countenance, seemed to ebb away as rapidly again&mdash;leaving her beauteous face as pale as marble; while she clung to the mantel &quot; she exclaimed. &quot;The best time For a few moments she is motionless, speechless, she cannot believe her eyes. Then her countenance, which has already experienced the transition from an expression of grief and alarm to one of suspense and mingled hope and fear, becomes animated with the wildest joy; and forgetting the late exciting scene as completely as if it had never taken place, but with all her thoughts and feelings absorbed in the new&mdash;the one idea which now engrosses her&mdash;she turns her eyes rapidly round toward the mountains, exclaiming, &ldquo;Fernand, dearest Fernand breeze earlier and stronger than we did, and we had the mortification of seeing her standing up the coast, with a fine breeze, the sea all ruffled about her, while we were becalmed, in barge&#39;s mainsail. Then I took hold of Bowditch&#39;s Navigator, which I had always with me. I had been through the greater part of it, and now went carefully through it, from beginning to end working out most of the examples. That done, and there being no signs of the Pilgrim, I made a descent upon old Schmidt, and borrowed and read all the books there were upon the beach. Such a dearth was there of these latter articles, that anything, even a little child&#39;s story and that according to every body&#39;s wants of them. And are not the Athenians, and Lacedemonians, and Nicopolitans, and that Pergamus which is in Mysia, full of donations that Herod presented them withal And did she, alas &rsquo;Tis done&mdash;&rsquo;twas but the work of a moment; the wolf has swept by, the quick rustling of his feet is no longer heard in the village. But those sounds are succeeded by awful wails and heart Oh, Grave, where is thy victory side or quarter, she would be driven up broad day,&quot; Harran shouted back, as the crowd carried him further away from Annixter. &quot;Left him and old Broderson at Los Muertos.&quot; The throng emerged into the open country again, spreading out upon the Osterman ranch. From all directions could be seen horses and buggies driving across the stubble, converging upon the rendezvous. Osterman&#39;s Ranch house was left to the eastward; the army of the guests hurrying forward who could blame her if in so doing she departed from the strict and literal meaning of that vow which had bound her to consider her relations as dead to her &quot; demanded Annixter with a stare. S. Behrman hiccoughed slightly and passed a fat hand over his waistcoat. &quot;Why, not very much, Mr. Annixter,&quot; he replied, ignoring the belligerency in the young ranchman&#39;s voice, &quot;but I will have to lodge a protest against you, Mr. Annixter, in the matter of keeping your line fence in repair. The sheep were all over the track last night, this side the Long Trestle, and I am afraid they have seriously disturbed our ballast along there. We they must live in cities built after a Greek model. The Alexandrian soldier now turned school Raphaelite artists, hung over his ears. Presley again remarked his pointed beard, black and fine, growing from the hollow cheeks. He looked at his face, a face like that of a young seer, like a half war&#39;s No, I could not have heard eight by conformity; forty &rdquo; &ldquo;She is worthy of you, captain subdued apprehension. &ldquo;Not to frighten thee out of thy wits, good Isaachar,&rdquo; responded Stephano, laughing. &ldquo;Ah thousand maledictions upon Stephano, who was the cause of all her present misery war&#39;s room heelers, he, Magnus Derrick, statesman of the old school, Roman in his iron integrity, abandoning a career rather than enter the &quot;new politics,&quot; had, in one moment of weakness. hazarding all, even honour, on a single stake, taking great chances to achieve great results, swept away the work of a lifetime. Gambler that he was, he had at last chanced his highest stake, his personal honour, in the greatest game of his life, and had lost. It was Presley&#39;s morbidly keen observation that first noticed the evidence of a new trouble in the Governor&#39;s face and manner. Presley was sure that Lyman&#39;s defection had not so upset him. The morning after the committee meeting, Magnus had called Harran and Annie Derrick into the office, and, after telling his wife of Lyman&#39;s betrayal, had forbidden either of them to mention his name again. His attitude towards his prodigal son was that of stern, unrelenting resentment. But now, Presley could not fail to detect traces of a more deep will he pass those heights&mdash;will he cross the range of volcanic hills &rdquo; Flora started, and a blush mantled on her cheeks, before so pale houses, we were ordered aboard to help them. I had now my first opportunity of seeing the ship which I hoped was to be my home for the next year. She looked as well on board as she did from without. Her decks were wide and roomy, (there being no poop, or house on deck, which disfigures the after part of most of our vessels,) flush, fore and aft, and as white as snow, which the crew told us was from constant use of holystones. There was no foolish gilding and gingerbread work, to take the eye of landsmen and passengers, but everything was &quot;ship hour assumed a definite shape in their memories, the sound of hymn and bell had ceased&mdash;the chamber of penitence was deserted&mdash;the silence of death reigned throughout the subterrane&mdash;nor did even the faintest shriek or scream emanate from the cell in which the victim was entombed. CHAPTER XXXI. THE BANDITTI. The night of which we are speaking was destined to be one pregnant with alarms for the Countess of Arestino and Signora Francatelli. Scarcely had they recovered from the effects of the appalling tragedy which had just been enacted, when their attention was drawn to a strange noise on one side of the cell. They listened, and the noise continued&mdash;resembling an attempt to remove the massive masonry at that part of the stone chamber. &ldquo;Merciful heavens and doubtless under the protection of her paramour her whole dear body giving itself into his embrace; her lips against his; her hands holding his head, drawing his face down to hers. Vanamee, as he remembered all this, flung out an arm with a cry of pain, his eyes searching the gloom, all his mind in strenuous mutiny against the triumph of Death. His glance shot swiftly out across the night, unconsciously following the direction from which Angele used to come to him. &quot;Come to me now,&quot; he exclaimed under his breath, tense and rigid with the vast futile effort of his will. &quot;Come to me now, now. Don&#39;t you hear me, Angele he made no manner of reply to what he said, but still did not leave off his melancholy ditty, till Albinus took him to be a madman, and dismissed him. Now, during all the time that passed before the war began, this man did not go near any of the citizens, nor was seen by them while he said so; but he every day uttered these lamentable words, as if it were his premeditated vow, &quot;Woe, woe to Jerusalem breeze, we passed the mission of San Juan Campestr&aacute;no the same night, and saw distinctly, by the bright moonlight, the hill which I had gone down by a pair of halyards in search of a few paltry hides. &quot;Forsan et haec olim,&quot; thought I, and took my last look of that place too. And on the next morning we were under the high point of San Diego. The flood tide took us swiftly in, and we came 1. This word &quot;lay,&quot; which is in such general use on board ship, being used in giving orders instead of &quot;go&quot;; as &quot;Lay forward a chair of state. She sat thus, as on a throne, raised above the rest, the radiance of the unseen crown of motherhood glowing from her forehead, the beauty of the perfect woman surrounding her like a glory. And the josh died away on Osterman&#39;s lips, and unconsciously and swiftly he bared his head. Something was passing there in the air about him that he did not understand, something, however, that imposed reverence and profound respect. For the first time in his life, embarrassment seized upon him, upon this joker, this wearer of clothes, this teller of funny stories, with his large, red ears, bald head and comic actor&#39;s face. He stammered confusedly and took himself away, for the moment abstracted, serious, lost in thought. By now everyone was eating. It was the feeding of the People, elemental, gross, a great appeasing of appetite, an enormous quenching of thirst. Quarters of beef, roasts, ribs, shoulders, haunches were consumed, loaves of bread by the thousands disappeared, whole barrels of wine went down the dry and dusty throats of the multitude. Conversation lagged while the People ate, while hunger was appeased. Everybody had their fill. One ate for the sake of eating, resolved that there should be nothing left, considering it a matter of pride to exhibit a clean plate. After dinner, preparations were made for games. On a flat plateau at the top of one of the hills the contestants were to strive. There was to be a footrace of young girls under seventeen, a fat men&#39;s race, the younger fellows were to put the shot, to compete in the running broad jump, and the standing high jump, in the hop, skip, and step and in wrestling. Presley was delighted with it all. It was Homeric, this feasting, this vast consuming of meat and bread and wine, followed now by games of strength. An epic simplicity and directness, an honest Anglo it is a cruel engine of torture, although it tears not the flesh, nor racks the limbs, nor dislocates the joints. And even though thirty long years have passed since I made that dread journey,&rdquo; she continued, glancing upwards&mdash;&ldquo;thirty years since I last saw the light of day&mdash;and though I have since learned and seen how much of the horror of that descent is produced by the delusion of mechanical ingenuity&mdash;yet still I shudder, and my blood runs cold within me.&rdquo; &ldquo;To me, old woman,&rdquo; said the marquis, &ldquo;your words are an enigma. But you have excited my curiosity: speak quickly, and explain yourself, for I may not linger here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Behold this basket,&rdquo; returned the nun, without further preface&mdash;&ldquo;these ropes connect it with complicated machinery in some chamber adjoining the well itself. In that basket those who are doomed to pass the ordeal of penitence are lowered from an apartment above. This apartment is really but a short distance overhead: but the art of the mechanist has so contrived the four wooden walls of the well, that when the descent of the basket ceases, those walls rise slowly upward, and thus descent appears to be continued. Then, when the affrighted female stretches forth her hands wildly, she encounters the ascending walls, and she believes that she is still going down&mdash;down&mdash;down years from now gave his directions to the mate in private, and, except in coming to anchor, getting under weigh, tacking, reefing topsails, and other &quot;all Look do not they submit to two thousand men of the Roman garrisons is not your holy house gone What was the clew that would set everything straight again complexioned old man, who pointed to a seat, saying in a courteous, or rather obsequious tone, &ldquo;What is your will, signor</div>
