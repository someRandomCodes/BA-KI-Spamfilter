Hewett's appearances for Somerset in 1889 were more successful. Having previously appeared in the middle-order, Hewett switched to opening the innings at the start of the season, and took on the captaincy.[29] He scored three half-centuries in the season: two against Warwickshire, and one against Staffordshire.[n 2] He comfortably headed the Somerset batting with an average of 38 in matches against the other second-class counties.[33] In his history of Somerset cricket, Sunshine, Sixes and Cider, David Foot describes Hewett's selection policy as captain as being one that was more dependent on the cricketing ability of the player than "of [the player's] social charm and ability to drink into the early hours"—unlike some of his predecessors.[34] In 1890, his side were unbeaten against county opposition, winning the "Second-class County Championship".[35] In an early season first-class appearance for A. J. Webbe's XI, Hewett scored his maiden first-class century, reaching 114 against Cambridge University.[36] Later in May, for the MCC against Oxford University, he scored 71.[37] Hewett top-scored with 65 in the second-innings of Somerset's opening county match of 1890,[38] and two matches later scored 64 during a first-wicket partnership of 115 with Lionel Palairet against Leicestershire.[39] A string of lower scores followed for just under a month before Somerset hosted Staffordshire at Taunton. Having dismissed the visitors for 43, Hewett remained 203 not out when he declared the Somerset innings closed, scored in four hours, "a remarkable display of powerful and well-timed hitting".[40][41] He did not pass 100 again that season, but came close during the Scarborough Festival, being bowled for 99 in the second-innings for the Gentlemen of England.[42] Hewett led Somerset's batting averages in 1890, during which the club won twelve and tied one of their thirteen matches against county opposition. Due to this record the county were admitted to the County Championship for 1891 after a unanimous vote, regaining their first-class status.[43] While Red Lillywhite assessed him as "a dangerous left-hand bat, very fr
