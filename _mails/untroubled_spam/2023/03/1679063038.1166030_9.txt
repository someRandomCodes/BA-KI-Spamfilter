DMG started out as Demon Records, a British record label, founded in 1980 by former United Artists A&R executive Andrew Lauder and Jake Riviera. Riviera had previously started Stiff Records and, with Lauder, had also founded Radar Records in 1978 and F-Beat in 1979.[2] The label was originally planned to release one-off singles, with early releases from the Subterraneans (featuring NME journalist Nick Kent), the Spectres (formed by Glen Matlock), TV21, and Department S.[2] Demon's first chart success came with Department S's "Is Vic There?" which reached No. 22 on the UK Singles Chart.[3] Further chart success followed with Bananarama's "Aie a Mwana". The label then changed direction towards launching long-term artists. Lauder left to join Island Records in 1981, and Demon started a subsidiary label, Edsel Records, the same year, for reissues of 1960s and 1970s albums. By 1982, Lauder had returned, and Demon had spawned further sub-labels, including Hi Records (the Memphis soul label) and Drop Out (psychedelic rock).[2] Demon was also the home of sub-label Zippo, which released albums by American artists such as Dream Syndicate, Green on Red, True West, Rain Parade, Russ Tolman, amongst others in the 1980s. In 1998, Demon was acquired by Crimson Productions and the record label was merged with its Westside Records operation. In 2002, Westside issued a double CD compilation album of blues from Ace Records. The company is now known as the Demon Music Group and releases records by artists such as Jane McDonald and Marti Pellow. Demon is also the European licensee of the Hi Records catalog. The firm is also known for releasing a large number of compilation albums, with multi-genre compilation brands including the Absolute Hits series of single-disc collections (through Crimson) and the budget-range 100 Hits series of five-disc box sets each themed to a particular genre or era of music. These have proved successful, with the 100 Hits series alone amassing sales of 1.5 million units in its first 18 months on sale.[4] The firm also releases genre-based compilation sets through labels such as Harmless (funk) and Nascente (world music).
