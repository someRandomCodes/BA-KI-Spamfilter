Hey,

I found the weirdest, most brutally effective tool for storing my sidearm that I've ever seen online.

It's actually where my CCW is hanging out right now.

The best part is that it gives me a way FASTER finger-to-trigger time than my holster does.

...Even after practicing for years, this thing is faster!

It's unlike anything I've ever laid my eyes on (I don't say that lightly).

In fact, after buying one for myself, I contacted the manufacturer and struck a deal to get these Rapid Access Mounts produced for you, my loyal subscribers.

The manufacturer agreed to send over 500 immediately and I figured I'd let my subscribers act as "Early Adopters."

These won't last long though, since this is going out to a list of over 100,000 tactical gearheads...

P.S. These mounts are so strong they allow you to rack the slide while it's still mounted under your dash/desk!
