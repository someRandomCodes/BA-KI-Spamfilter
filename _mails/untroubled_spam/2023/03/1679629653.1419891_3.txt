Regardless of how much you hit the gym, how well you eat or how much you look after your body, hours spent sitting at a desk with your neck craned over a keyboard or constantly arching your head down to look at your smart phone eats away at your health in ways you could never predict.

Take a look at the picture below. I catch myself sitting like this sometimes and this picture reminds me how every minute spent in this position contributes to pain and damage to the body.

The position picture above is referred to as Office Guy Syndrome.

It's like the old man's hunch curving your body forward with your shoulders dropped making you look weak, submissive and shorter than you really are.

The curve of your neck and back means you may drop height by a couple of inches and look a lot older than you are.

allying claims for the many Soviet pilots who claim to have achieved ace status is extremely difficult. The system of claims awards in the Soviet Union was unclear and appears to have been highly inconsistent during the war. There is also no single list of victories for each pilot in the Soviet Union, with numbers instead drawn from after action reports and accounts from pilots and unit leaders. These complications, in addition to the intentional exaggeration of kills in order to please superiors, means that the about 50 Soviet pilots claiming ace status have a total number of victories which far exceeds the number of aircraft the UN lost in the Korean War's air battles.[7] Realizing the chronic problem with false claims, Soviet leaders began to tighten the criteria for confirming victories in 1952. As a result, far fewer Soviet pilots were made aces in the second half of the war.[19] Similarly, data-matching shows that US aces also over-claimed. [20] For example, the US claimed that James Jabara became the world's first jet-versus-jet ace during his first tour of duty, but Soviet data shows he didn't achieve ace status until his second tour. List of aces China Various sources claim that between six and nine Chinese pilots attained ace status during the course of the war.[7] A USAF report listed six Chinese pilots attained ace status during the Korean War.[21] Although all Chinese aces have recer
