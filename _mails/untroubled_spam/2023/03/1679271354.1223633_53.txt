hy, thus recommended to the President that Rutledge be appointed.[14]:=E2=
=80=8A292=E2=80=8A After meeting with Rutledge at the White House and being=
 convinced by Biddle that the judge's judicial philosophy was fully aligned=
 with his own, Roosevelt agreed.[15]:=E2=80=8A186=E2=80=8A According to the=
 scholar Fred L. Israel, Roosevelt found Rutledge to be "a liberal New Deal=
er who combined the President's respect for the academic community with fou=
r years of service on a leading federal appellate court".[2]:=E2=80=8A1318=
=E2=80=8A Additionally, the fact that Rutledge was a Westerner weighed in h=
is favor.[14]:=E2=80=8A292=E2=80=8A The President told his nominee: "Wiley,=
 we had a number of candidates for the Court who were highly qualified, but=
 they didn't have geography=E2=80=94you have that".[2]:=E2=80=8A1318=E2=80=
=8A

Roosevelt formally nominated Rutledge, who was then forty-eight years old, =
to the Supreme Court on January 11, 1943.[10]:=E2=80=8A375=E2=80=8A The Sen=
ate Judiciary Committee voted on February 1 to approve Rutledge's nominatio=
n; the vote was 11=E2=80=930, with four abstentions.[16] Those four senator=
s=E2=80=94North Dakota's William Langer, West Virginia's Chapman Revercomb,=
 Montana's Burton K. Wheeler, and Michigan's Homer S. Ferguson=E2=80=94abst=
ained due to uneasiness about Rutledge's support for Roosevelt's court-expa=
nsion plan.[1]:=E2=80=8A220=E2=80=8A Ferguson later spoke with Rutledge and=
 indicated that his concerns had been resolved, but Wheeler, who had strong=
ly opposed Roosevelt's efforts to enlarge the Court, said that he would vot=
e against the nomination when it came before the full Senate.[1]:=E2=80=8A2=
20=E2=80=8A The only senator to speak on the Senate floor in opposition to =
Rutledge was Langer, who characterized Rutledge as "a man who, so far as I =
can ascertain, never practiced law inside a courtroom or, so far as I know,=
 seldom even visited one until he came to take a seat on the United States =
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia" and commented that "=
[t]he Court is not without a professor or two already."[1]:=E2=80=8A220=E2=
