Could this crazy “ear popping”? secret mean the end to your tinnitus?

This mad scientist seems to think so and thousands already agree to him, after testing it and clearing their ear ringing in the weeks after.

He posted it here…

He says he’ll keep it online for as long as he can, apparently Big Pharma is already knocking at his door, threatening to go to court.

Apparently it also restored hearing in 98% of the participants.

So if you want to stop ear ringing and regain your crystal clear hearing, then check this out now while you still can.

The crazy doctor is being forced to take it down by the end of next week.

The earliest writing containing statistics in Europe dates back to 1663, with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt.[16] Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its stat- etymology. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences. The mathematical foundations of statistics developed from discussions concerning games of chance among mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano, Blaise Pascal, Pierre de Fermat, and Christiaan Huygens. Although the idea of probability was already examined in ancient and medieval law and philosophy (such as the work of Juan Caramuel), probability theory as a mathematical discipline only took shape at the very end of the 17th century, particularly in Jacob Bernoulli's posthumous work Ars Conjectandi.[17] This was the first book where the realm of games of chance and the realm of the probable (which concerned opinion, evidence, and argument) were combined and submitted to mathematical analysis.[18][19] The method of least squares was first described by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, though Carl Friedrich Gauss presumably made use of it a decade earlier in 1795.[20] Karl Pearson, a founder of mathematical statistics. The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.[21] The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts
