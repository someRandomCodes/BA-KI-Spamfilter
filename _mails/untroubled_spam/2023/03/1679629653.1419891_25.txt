tail-end of the 1893 season, he played three times for the South, scoring two half-centuries.[80][81] In July 1894, Hewett made the second of his two appearances for the Gentlemen against the Players. Unlike his first appearance, made at Hastings, the match was played at Lord's Cricket Ground,[14] which was generally considered to be the more prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture of the season, being the more representative.[82] These matches were keenly contested during the 1890s, and were considered to be second in prestige only to gaining a Test cap.[83] Batting at number three, Hewett scored 12 runs out of the Gentlemen's total of 254, before Stanley Jackson and Hewett's former Somerset colleague, Sammy Woods, bowled the Players out for 108 and 107.[84] He appeared 11 times in 1894, scoring 579 runs at an average of 34.05, higher than the previous season. Woods described Hewett as being "in splendid form" when he played, and lamented that he was no longer playing for Somerset.[85] He scored his only century of the season for A. J. Webbe's XI, reaching 110 after opening the innings against Oxford University.[86] He continued his form with the bat into 1895, twice scoring centuries for the Gentlemen against the universities, making 109 against Cambridge,[87] and 102 against Oxford.[88] During this season Hewett appeared in his first match for the amateur side I Zingari, who had strong links with both Harrow School and Somerset president Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane.[14] Hewett played all three matches of the 1895 Scarborough Festival; he opened the innings for the MCC against Yorkshire, and then captained the South in their loss against the North. In the third match, Hewett was named captain of an England XI, a compliment for the former Somerset captain. However, rain meant the start was delayed. Unlike a couple of years earlier, Hewett was happy to ignore the puddles in the field and start the match at the scheduled time. The umpires disagreed with him, and the crowd, wanting cricket, blamed Hewett for the delay and lack of sport. When he belatedly led his side onto the field, the spectators threw insults at him until the Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, shouted "Keep quiet or I'll think about calling the game off".[89] Hewett did not bother with such threats, and left the field, got changed and departed from the ground, taking no further part in the game.[89] Fred Spofforth replaced him in the match which the Engl
