Just last summer, he and his wife decided to pay a visit to one of the most sacred tribes in Africa, the legendary Sombas.

They've been known for quite some time now by the elites and the scientific community for their special elongation method.

For many years, decades in fact, many people have been trying to learn the insights of this ritual, but with no luck.

Until this guy came and did the most unthinkable thing...

He gave his wife in exchange for the growth secret!

It was incredible! In fact, they filmed the whole thing and documented every step of this ritual...

BE CAREFUL.

This should be used wisely because it grows your member by 4 to 7 inches in a few weeks.

In fact, it already created some monsters out there...

Oh... and if you wonder if the African tribe fellows scored on the white chick, the answer is YES!
That's why I said you have to see this...




















On 28 October 2002, in a network-wide relaunch, Granada was rebranded as ITV1 Granada. The Granada name was shown before regional programmes, but this has ceased; its name has all but disappeared from screens, as have all other ITV regional identities.[38] Since rebranding, all continuity announcements are made from London. The Granada logo appeared at the end of its own programmes until 31 October 2004. Granada was permitted by the government to merge with Carlton[39] on 2 February 2004 to form ITV plc.[40] The move was a takeover by Granada, whose market capitalisation was double that of Carlton, at nearly Â£2 billion.[citation needed] Granada owned 68% of the shares and Carlton 32%; chairman designate Michael Green was ousted by shareholders[41] and the majority of new board members originated from Granada.[42] Carlton employees were subsumed in Granada operations or made redundant,[43] with three out of four new departments led by Granada staff.[44] From 1 November 2004, Granada productions were credited "Granada Manchester", the brand of the unified in-house production arm but on 21 September 2005, it was announced that Granada's name would no longer appear at the end of programmes. The in-house production arm was renamed ITV Productions. The change on 16 January 2006 coincided with a relaunch of ITV's on-screen graphics. Granada's name and logo were used at the end of programmes made for other networks, such as University Challenge for BBC Two, and old programmes shown on BSkyB channels Sky One, and the former Sky Two (now Sky Replay) and Sky Three (now Pick), until 2009. In November 2006, Granada lost its on-air identity when regional programming voiced ITV1 or ITV1 Granada over a generic ident. Local news coverage was branded Granada News except for the main 18.00 G
