ation, that you will watch unweariedly and unceasingly over the welfare and=
 the interests of Francisco&mdash;that you will make any sacrifice, incur a=

linger, with an angry shrug of one shoulder, took himself away. At length, =
Annixter brought Hilma through the crowd to where young Vacca was waiting w=

 wishing to ask some questions at the freight office about a final consignm=

he should be no more. And I remember, also, that the look and the sign, by =

sun glinted with oscillating and dying power. She still continued to gaze f=
rom the window long after he had disappeared; obscurity was gathering rapid=
ly around; but, even had it been noonday, she would have seen nothing. Her =
ideas grew bewildered: mortification, grief, anger, suspicion, burning desi=
re, all mingled together and at length produced a species of stunning effec=
t upon her, so that the past appeared to be a dream, and the future was wra=
pt in the darkest gloom and uncertainty. This strange condition of her mind=
 did not, however, last long; the natural energy of her character speedily =
asserted its empire over the intellectual lethargy which had seized upon he=
r, and, awakening from her stupor, she resolved to waste not another instan=
t in useless conjecture as to the cause of her lover&rsquo;s conduct. Haste=
ning to her own apartments, she dismissed Flora Francatelli, whom she found=
 there, with an abruptness of gesture and a frowning expression of countena=

so that as the latter hastened from the room, tears started from her eyes, =

F THIS HIGH AMBITION WHEN the Achaeans had left their homes along the banks=
 of the Danube to look for pastures new, they had spent some time among the=
 mountains of Macedonia. Ever since, the Greeks had maintained certain more=
 or less formal relations with the people of this northern country. The Mac=
edonians from their side had kept themselves well informed about conditions=
 in Greece. Now it happened, just when Sparta and Athens had finished their=
 disastrous war for the leadership of Hellas, that Macedonia was ruled by a=
n extraordinarily clever man by the name of Philip. He admired the Greek sp=
irit in letters and art but he despised the Greek lack of self I tell you w=
hat, you&#39;ve got to look at these things in a large way. You&#39;ve got =
to judge by results. Well, now, what do you think &rdquo; &ldquo;I am at yo=
ur service,&rdquo; responded Stephano. &ldquo;Monday will suit me admirably=
, and midnight shall be the hour. And now instruct me in the nature of the =
locality.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come with me, and I will show you by which way you =
and your comrades must effect an entry,&rdquo; said Antonio. The valet and =
the robber piece on, nor his breastplate, (for, as I told you, he went out =
not to fight, but to view the city,) none of them touched his body, but wen=
t aside without hurting him; as if all of them missed him on purpose, and o=
nly made a noise as they passed by him. So he diverted those perpetually wi=
th his sword that came on his side, and overturned many of those that direc=
tly met him, and made his horse ride over those that were overthrown. The e=
nemy indeed made a shout at the boldness of Caesar, and exhorted one anothe=
r to rush upon him. Yet did these against whom he marched fly away, and go =
off from him in great numbers; while those that were in the same danger wit=
h him kept up close to him, though they were wounded both on their backs an=
d on their sides; for they had each of them but this one hope of escaping, =
if they could assist Titus in opening himself a way, that he might not be e=
ncompassed round by his enemies before he got away from them. Now there wer=
e two of those that were with him, but at some distance; the one of which t=
he enemy compassed round, and slew him with their darts, and his horse also=
; but the other they slew as he leaped down from his horse, and carried off=
 his horse with them. But Titus escaped with the rest, and came safe to the=
 camp. So this success of the Jews&#39; first attack raised their minds, an=
d gave them an ill OUR Mission None of them in HIS, thank you. HE had seen =
Hilma Tree give him a look in the dairy. Aha, he saw through her &quot; To =
his mind it was the last insult, the most outrageous calumny. He had no wor=
se epithet at his command. &quot; chosen legate should be sent into Greece,=
 to convene the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jeru=
salem; and, with their aid, to prepare a free and universal synod. But at t=
his moment,&quot; continued the subtle agent, &quot;the empire is assaulted=
 and endangered by the Turks, who have occupied four of the greatest cities=
 of Anatolia. The Christian inhabitants have expressed a wish of returning =
to their allegiance and religion; but the forces and revenues of the empero=
r are insufficient for their deliverance: and the Roman legate must be acco=
mpanied, or preceded, by an army of Franks, to expel the infidels, and open=
 a way to the holy sepulchre.&quot; If the suspicious Latins should require=
 some pledge, some previous effect of the sincerity of the Greeks, the answ=
ers of Barlaam were perspicuous and rational. &quot;1. A general synod can =
alone consummate the union of the churches; nor can such a synod be held ti=
ll the three Oriental patriarchs, and a great number of bishops, are enfran=
chised from the Mahometan yoke. 2. The Greeks are alienated by a long serie=
s of oppression and injury: they must be reconciled by some act of brotherl=
y love, some effectual succor, which may fortify the authority and argument=
s of the emperor, and the friends of the union. 3. If some difference of fa=
ith or ceremonies should be found incurable, the Greeks, however, are the d=
isciples of Christ; and the Turks are the common enemies of the Christian n=
ame. The Armenians, Cyprians, and Rhodians, are equally attacked; and it wi=
ll become the piety of the French princes to draw their swords in the gener=
al defence of religion. 4. Should the subjects of Andronicus be treated as =
the worst of schismatics, of heretics, of pagans, a judicious policy may ye=
t instruct the powers of the West to embrace a useful ally, to uphold a sin=
king empire, to guard the confines of Europe; and rather to join the Greeks=
 against the Turks, than to expect the union of the Turkish arms with the t=
roops and treasures of captive Greece.&quot; The reasons, the offers, and t=
he demands, of Andronicus were eluded with cold and stately indifference. T=
he kings of France and Naples declined the dangers and glory of a crusade; =
the pope refused to call a new synod to determine old articles of faith; an=

w that she had made her confession to him. He would see her as soon as poss=
ible and get this business straightened out, and begin again from a new sta=
rting point. What he wanted with Hilma, Annixter did not define clearly in =
his mind. At one time he had known perfectly well what he wanted. Now, the =
goal of his desires had become vague. He could not say exactly what it was.=
 He preferred that things should go forward without much idea of consequenc=
es; if consequences came, they would do so naturally enough, and of themsel=
ves; all that he positively knew was that Hilma occupied his thoughts morni=

when away from her. The Chinese cook served his supper in silence. Annixter=
 ate and drank and lighted a cigar, and after his meal sat on the porch of =
his house, smoking and enjoying the twilight. The evening was beautiful, wa=
rm, the sky one powder of stars. From the direction of the stables he heard=
 one of the Portuguese hands picking a guitar. But he wanted to see Hilma. =
The idea of going to bed without at least a glimpse of her became distastef=
ul to him. Annixter got up and descending from the porch began to walk aiml=
essly about between the ranch buildings, with eye and ear alert. Possibly h=
