<p>chief of an unseen army, and he a subaltern. There was some little conversation as to the proposed dance, and then Annixter found an excuse for drawing the Governor aside. Mrs. Derrick watched the two with eyes full of poignant anxiety, as they slowly paced the length of the gravel driveway to the road gate, and stood there, leaning upon it, talking earnestly; Magnus tall, thin horse team succeeding six grade of the value of the railroad sections included in the Los Muertos, Quien Sabe, Osterman and Broderson properties was made before the first of the year. Naturally, the tenants of these lands feel an interest in the price which the railroad will put upon its holdings, and it is rumoured they expect the land will be offered to them for two dollars and fifty cents per acre. It needs no seventh daughter of a seventh daughter to foresee that these gentlemen will be disappointed.&quot; &quot;Rot out. This is what is called &quot;hazing&quot; a crew, and &quot;working their old iron up.&quot; While lying at Santa Barbara, we encountered another south by, somebody else will go after some more, and if they beat him, he&#39;ll have to go again, or else give up his berth. That&#39;s the way they do it. This old covey knows the ropes. He has worked a traverse over &#39;em, and come &#39;way out here, where nobody&#39;s ever been afore, and where they&#39;ll never think of coming.&quot; This explanation satisfied Jack; and as it raised Mr. N.&#39;s credit for capacity, and was near enough to the truth for common purposes, I did not disturb it. With the exception of Mr. N., we had no one on board but the regular ship&#39;s company, and the live stock. Upon this, we had made a considerable inroad. We killed one of the bullocks every four days, so that they did not last us up to the line. We, or, rather, they, then began upon the sheep and the poultry, for these never come into Jack&#39;s mess.(1) The pigs were left poor girl&mdash;she cannot hear the words which fall from my lips day, it was leaving him alone, his last friend turning against him. Slowly it was going back towards Bonneville, to the shops of the Railroad, the camp of the enemy, that enemy that had ruined him and wrecked him. For the last time in his life, he had been the engineer. Now, once more, he became the highwayman, the outlaw against whom all hands were raised, the fugitive skulking in the mountains, listening for the cry of dogs. But he would not give in. They had not broken him yet. Never, while he could fight, would he allow S. Behrman the triumph of his capture. He found his wound was not bad. He plunged into the wheat on Quien Sabe, making northward for a division house that rose with its surrounding trees out of the wheat like an island. He reached it, the blood squelching in his shoes. But the sight of two men, Portuguese farm &quot; the swinging of a rope, On reaching the door of the chamber, Francisco knocked gently; and the glance of intelligence which passed between himself and Flora showed that each was a prey to the same breathless suspense; the same mingled feelings of bright hopes and vague fears. In a few moments the door was slowly opened; and the venerable old man appeared, his countenance wearing a solemn and mournful aspect. Then Francisco and the young countess knew that all was over; and tears started into their eyes. Christian Rosencrux beckoned them to advance toward the bed, around which the curtains were drawn closer; and as they entered the room, the rapid and simultaneous glances which they cast toward the spot where Fernand Wagner fell down and surrendered up his breath, showed them that the corpse had been removed. Approaching the bed with slow and measured steps, Rosencrux drew aside the drapery; and for a moment Francisco and Flora shrank back from the spectacle which met their view; but at the next instant they advanced to the couch, and contemplated with mournful attention the scene presented to them. For there&mdash;upon that couch&mdash;side by side, lay Fernand Wagner and Nisida of Riverola&mdash;stiff, motionless, cold. &ldquo;Grieve not for her loss, children,&rdquo; said Christian Rosencrux; &ldquo;she has gone to a happier realm&mdash;for the sincere repentance which she manifested in her last hours has atoned for all the evil she wrought in her lifetime. From the moment, young lady, when she banished from her soul the rancor long harbored there against thee&mdash;from the instant that she received thee in her arms, and called thee sister&mdash;the blessing of Heaven was vouchsafed unto her. She was penitent, very penitent, while I administered to her the consolations of religion, and a complete change came over her mind. Grieve not, then, for her; happy on earth she never could have been again&mdash;but happy in heaven she doubtless now is ME, I get der sach alzoh, hey all the traffic would bear law, Abu my beloved native land, thou too, fair city, whose name is fraught with so many varied reminiscences for me, am I doomed never to visit ye more &quot; his face flamed scarlet, &quot;Ach, du lieber Gott naked form of Giulia of Arestino, its symmetry convulsing in matchless tortures, the bosom palpitating awfully with the pangs of that earthly hell, and the exquisitely like art thou, my Fernand ashore jackets and trowsers got out and brushed; pumps, neckerchiefs, and hats overhauled; one lending to another; so that among the whole each one got a good fit sails, all in a mess, which half an hour won&#39;t set right; yards braced sharp up; and she&#39;s on the starboard tack, close hauled. The studding be it so informed, if the long &quot; &quot;It&#39;s got THIS to do with us,&quot; returned the other with a sudden aggressiveness, &quot;that the freight rate has gone up to meet the price. We&#39;re not doing business for our health. My orders are to raise your rate to five cents, and I think you are getting off easy.&quot; Dyke stared in blank astonishment. For the moment, the audacity of the affair was what most appealed to him. He forgot its personal application. &quot;Good Lord,&quot; he murmured, &quot;good Lord topa, the Tartar &rdquo; exclaimed Francisco, starting back in surprise not unmingled with anger; &ldquo;you were there, Flora&mdash;and you knew that I was in despair concerning thee&mdash;that I would have given worlds to have heard of thy safety,&mdash;I, who thought that some fiend in human shape had sent thee to an early grave dozen greyhounds, following the chase on horseback. One day, between two and three months after Lyman s visit to Los Muertos, as he was returning toward the ranch house from a distant and lonely quarter of Los Muertos, he came unexpectedly upon a strange sight. Some twenty men, Annixter&#39;s and Osterman&#39;s tenants, and small ranchers from east of Guadalajara here,&quot; he drew a long strip of paper from his pocket, &quot;here&#39;s a galley proof of the story.&quot; Magnus took it in his hands. There, under his eyes, scare such is the language of the historian The idea pump What have you to say Vanamee&#39;s herd west Coast, and come down in a small vessel to Monterey. There he learned that there was a ship at the leeward, about to sail for Boston; and, taking passage in the Pilgrim, which was then at Monterey, he came slowly down, visiting the intermediate ports, and examining the trees, plants, earths, birds, etc., and joined us at San Diego shortly before we sailed. The second mate of the Pilgrim told me that they had an old gentleman on board who knew me, and came from the college that I had been in. He could not recollect his name, but said he was a &quot;sort of an oldish man,&quot; with white hair, and spent all his time in the bush, and along the beach, picking up flowers and shells, and such truck, and had a dozen boxes and barrels, full of them. I thought over everybody who would be likely to be there, but could fix upon no one; when, the next day, just as we were about to shove off from the beach, he came down to the boat, in the rig I have described, with his shoes in his hand, and his pockets full of specimens. I knew him at once, though I should not have been more surprised to have seen the Old South steeple shoot up from the hide that destiny is a sad one fear not&mdash;I will not harm thee An explanation occurred to him. Was this merely a pleasantry on the part of S.

It being Sunday, and nothing to do, all hands were on the forecastle, criticising the new All the philosophy in the universe could never convert this shop into a palace.&rdquo; &ldquo;But you are wandering from your subject, my good friend,&rdquo; gently remonstrated Fernand. &ldquo;I crave your pardon, signor. Let me see. Oh, I recollect; we were talking of Christianus Rosencrux. Well, signor, the fabled philosopher was a monk, and a very wise as well as a very good man. I am only telling you the most generally received legend, mind, and would not have you think that I believe it myself. So this Rosencrux, finding that his cloistral existence was inconvenient for the prosecution of his studies, traveled into the East, and spent many years in acquiring the knowledge handed down to the wise men of those climes by the ancient Magi and Chaldeans. He visited Egypt, and learnt many wonderful secrets by studying the hieroglyphics on the Egyptian pyramids. I forget how long he remained in the East; but it is said that he visited every place of interest in the Holy Land, and received heavenly inspirations on the spot where our Saviour was crucified. On his return to Europe, he saw full well that if he revealed all his knowledge at once, he would be put to death by the inquisition as a wizard, and the world would lose the benefit of all the learning he had acquired. So says the legend; and it goes on to recite that Christianus Rosencrux then founded the order of the Rosy Cross, which was nothing more or less than a brotherhood of wise men whom he initiated in all his secrets, with the intention that they should reveal from time to time small portions thereof, and thus give to the world by very slow degrees that immense amount of knowledge which he supposed would have stupefied and astounded everybody if made public all at once.&rdquo; &ldquo;Strange&mdash;most strange,&rdquo; thought Wagner within himself, &ldquo;that I should never have gleaned all these details before, eager as my inquiries and researches in the pursuit of knowledge have been. But Heaven has willed everything for the best; and it is doubtless intended that my salvation shall proceed from the very quarter which was least known to me, and concerning which I have manifested the most contemptuous indifference, in the sphere of knowledge &mdash;where is my son You&#39;re always hanging out blue lights out for rocks and sands and turns of tides; houses, theatres, and hospitals; its daily journals; its well acquired provinces. The slaves they bought in open market wherever they happened to be cheapest. During most of the third and second centuries before Christ there was a plentiful supply, and as a result the landowners worked their slaves until they dropped dead in their tracks, when they bought new ones at the nearest bargain Yes, that&#39;s it,&quot; he continued, more reassured. &quot;I don&#39;t like the idea of any one disliking me. That&#39;s the way I am. It&#39;s my nature.&quot; &quot;Oh, then,&quot; returned Hilma, &quot;you needn&#39;t bother. No, I don&#39;t dislike you.&quot; &quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; declared Annixter judicially. &quot;That&#39;s good. But hold on,&quot; he interrupted, &quot;I&#39;m forgetting. It&#39;s not enough to not dislike me. I want you to like me. How about THAT &quot;Every dog must have his day, and mine will come by can&#39;t fence along our right of way.

He felt himself grow pale, his heart became a mere leaden weight in his chest, inert, refusing to beat. In a second the whole affair, in all its bearings, went speeding before the eye of his imagination like the rapid unrolling of a panorama. Every cent of his earnings was sunk in this hop business of his. More than that, he had borrowed money to carry it on, certain of success Garnett of the Ruby ranch, Gethings of the San Pablo, Keast of the ranch of the same name, Chattern of the Bonanza, elderly men, bearded, slow of speech, deliberate.

He had done his duty toward Rome and he had fought her battles without complaint. But when he came home after ten, fifteen or twenty years, his lands were covered with weeds and his family had been ruined. But he was a strong man and willing to begin life anew. He sowed and planted and waited for the harvest. He carried his grain to the market together with his cattle and his poultry, to find that the large landowners who worked their estates with slaves could underbid him all along the line. For a couple of years he tried to hold his own. Then he gave up in despair. He left the country and he went to the nearest city. In the city he was as hungry as he had been before on the land. But he shared his misery with thousands of other disinherited beings. They crouched together in filthy hovels in the suburbs of the large cities. They were apt to get sick and die from terrible epidemics. They were all profoundly discontented. They had fought for their country and this was their reward. They were always willing to listen to those plausible spell four hours into seven watches instead of six, and thus shift the hours every night.
