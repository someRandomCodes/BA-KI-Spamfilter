A cyclone pre-warning was issued for the island of Réunion on 4 March.[17] The cyclone pre-warning ended at 6:00 p.m. Réunion Time (14:00 UTC) on 5 March, as Dumazile veered away from the island. Schools and businesses remained closed through 6 March.[26][27][28] All schools reopened on 7 March, with the exception of several in Saint-Paul and Saint-Leu, where roadways were still blocked.[29] Torrential rainfall affected the island, a 24-hour total of 990 mm (39 in) occurring at Grand Îlet. The Volcanic Highway, La Plaine-des-Palmistes, and Cilaos all experienced significant rainfall during the same period.[17][30] Severe damage was inflicted to the road system on Réunion. Roads across the island experienced landslides, flooding, and downed trees.[31] East and westbound traffic traveling across the island was restricted to the Plaines highway, due to other roads flooding.[32] The coastal and mountain highways were closed following the storm.[28] A section of the mountain road was covered in debris after a landslide occurred.[17] Strong waves submerged four lanes of the coastal highway with seawater. Approximately 150 mm (5.9 in) of rain fell on a cliff overlooking the coastal road, prompting an inspection before the road was able to reopen.[33] A large lake developed on the Plaine des Cafres, due to heavy rainfall.[32] Several bridges were either swept away or submerged by floodwaters, and several roads were flooded across Cilaos and Salazie.[34] The ReNovRisk project utilized three seismic stations in the Salazie Basin to measure microseismic data and determine the level of sediment transport down a river.[35] Landslides occurred in two neighborhoods of Brittany, and a wall collapsed in the mountainous region.[36] A landslide in the Piton Cailloux District, Sainte-Marie, isolated around 10 families.[37] High waves along the shore decimated boats in the port of Sainte-Marie. The Roches Noires beach was completely submerged in water.[17] A fence and the northern access to an esplanade at the beach collapsed.[38] Significant portions of sand were washed away from the beach, exposing the foundations of the esplanade.[39] The MNS beach surveillance station and three masts used for signalling sustained damage. As a result, the lifeguard station was closed and rescues were no longer possible
