GET HAARKO


There are so many amazing Haarko features. Here are some of our favorite traits:

1. Haarko can slice, dice, or chop ANYTHING

With a super sharp blade, there is nothing that Haarko can’t do. No matter how tough an ingredient is, Haarko is the tool you need.

Plus, having a sharper blade is much safer than using your old kitchen knife. That’s because you won’t have to use much pressure, which is what leads to slips!

2. Dimpled blade prevents stickiness

How annoying is it when food gets stuck to your blade?

This is something you won’t have to worry about with Haarko!

Haarko has a dimpled blade, meaning that sticky foods will easily separate while chopping.

3. Index finger hole for support

Haarko has a signature laser-carved hole that is meant for your index finger. It gives you much more support, balance, and comfort.

The PC version received "favourable" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.[28] A Shacknews staff poll named the PC version the seventh-best game of 2013, calling it "delightfully devoid of explanation".[51] Reviewers praised the game's dynamic audio, commenting positively on how it accompanied them through the game. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid called the game's dynamic soundtrack its "biggest accomplishment", with Hancock investigating every object he saw to uncover its musical contribution.[33] IGN wrote, "It's oddly captivating to just walk around and let [the sounds] wash over your surroundings", going on to say that investigating the sounds that each object and animal made was an enjoyable experience.[6] PC Gamer described the audio as "a deeply satisfying emergent arrangement".[3][37] A review in Edge⁣, however, though generally positive about the soundtrack, said that the music "never truly gets going", particularly because of the lack of drums in most seasons.[34] The game's variety and replay value received mixed reactions. IGN's reviewer commented positively on the replayability, finding that the game provided a deeper experience on each subsequent playthrough.[6] GameSpot was less positive, writing that while some events and locations were not guaranteed on each generated island, later portions of the game were less interesting due to their familiarity.[4] Likewise, PC Gamer said that towards the end of the game they began to find it aimless and unstimulating, in particular because of the sparsity of animal life.[37] The PlayStation Vita version received "gener
