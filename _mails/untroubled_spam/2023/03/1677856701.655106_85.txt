 of the discussion, leaned abruptly forward. For the only time in his knowl=

in&#39;s good conduct when on shore, (especially where the case is one in w=
hich no evidence but that of sailors could have been brought against the ac=
cused), and then, on this ground, and on the invariable claims of the wife =
and family, be induced to cut down essentially the penalty imposed by a sta=
tute made expressly for masters and officers of merchantmen, and for no one=
 else. There are many particulars connected with the manning of vessels, th=
e provisions given to crews, and the treatment of them while at sea, upon w=
hich there might be a good deal said; but as I have, for the most part, rem=
arked upon them as they came up in the course of my narrative, I will offer=
 nothing further now, except on the single point of the manner of shipping =
men. This, it is well known, is usually left entirely to the shipping There=

 a wretched trick, a delusion. It is only Hell that is real.&quot; Sarria c=

 &quot;and it is blasphemy that you are saying. I forbid it. You understand=
 while we may have him for our emperor whom no one can blame, and who hath =
so many just reasons [to lay claim to the government]; and this with regard=
 to those against whom we are going to fight.&quot; When he had said this, =
he marched through the whole senate, and carried all the soldiers along wit=
h him. Upon which all the patricians were immediately in a great fright at =
their being thus deserted. But still, because there appeared no other way w=
hither they could turn themselves for deliverance, they made haste the same=
 way with the soldiers, and went to Claudius. But those that had the greate=
st luck in flattering the good fortune of Claudius betimes met them before =
the walls with their naked swords, and there was reason to fear that those =
that came first might have been in danger, before Claudius could know what =
violence the soldiers were going to offer them, had not Agrippa ran before,=
 and told him what a dangerous thing they were going about, and that unless=
 he restrained the violence of these men, who were in a fit of madness agai=
nst the patricians, he would lose those on whose account it was most desira=
ble to rule, and would be emperor over a desert. 5. When Claudius heard thi=
s, he restrained the violence of the soldiery, and received the senate into=
 the camp, and treated them after an obliging manner, and went out with the=
m presently to offer their thank easter. Returned to our anchorage the next=
 day. We were the only vessel in the port. The Pilgrim had passed through t=

water, bandages&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;It is nothing&mdash;a mere scra=

t sleeve of his doublet, and displaying a tolerably severe gash, which ran =
down the forearm lengthwise, and from which the blood trickled on the floor=
 &ldquo;Be kind enough to bind it with my scarf, Signor Verrina, and let u=
s continue in a more peaceful manner the discourse which has been somewhat =
rudely interrupted.&rdquo; Isaachar, however, supplied water in an ewer, an=
d linen bandages; and the old man, forgetting the object of Manuel&rsquo;s =
predatory visit to his abode, hastened himself to wash and bind up the woun=
ded arm. &ldquo;Thou art a good Jew&mdash;and hast something of the feeling=
 of the Christian in thee,&rdquo; said the marquis, when the operation was =
completed. &ldquo;Didst thou ever suppose that different creeds made differ=
ent hearts, my lord slip &rdquo; ejaculated Nisida, her countenance suddenl=
y assuming a stern and imperious expression: &ldquo;for the most important =
interests are involved in the marriage which he may contract. But enough of=
 this, Fernand,&rdquo; she added, relapsing into a more tender mood. &ldquo=

 an incarnate fiend,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;and admirably fitted to mate =
with the bandit captain.&rsquo; Such was my reflection then; and the lapse =
of a few hours has only served to strengthen the impression. You may now ju=
dge whether I have formed an unworthy attachment when we &quot;knocked off&=
quot; altogether, much to my joy; for, though I liked straying in the woods=
, and cutting, very well, yet the backing the wood for so great a distance,=
 over an uneven country, was, without exception, the hardest work I had eve=
r done. I usually had to kneel down and contrive to heave the load, which w=
as well strapped together, upon my back, and then rise up and start off wit=
h it up the hills and down the vales, sometimes through thickets, &quot; sa=
id Annixter. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. Some tom fool idea. Haven&#39;t we=
 got their terms printed in black and white in their circulars yard. I had =
seen it done once or twice at sea, and an old sailor, whose favor I had tak=
en some pains to gain, had taught me carefully everything which was necessa=
ry to be done, and in its proper order, and advised me to take the first op=
portunity when we were in port, and try it. I told the second mate, with wh=
om I had been pretty thick when he was before the mast, that I would do it,=
 and got him to ask the mate to send me up the first time they were struck.=
 Accordingly I was called upon, and went up, repeating the operations over =
in my mind, taking care to get everything in its order, for the slightest m=
istake spoils the whole. Fortunately, I got through without any word from t=
he officer, and heard the &quot;well done&quot; of the mate, when the yard =
reached the deck, with as much satisfaction as I ever felt at Cambridge on =
seeing a &quot;bene&quot; at the foot of a Latin exercise. CHAPTER XII LIFE=
 AT MONTEREY The next day being Sunday, which is the liberty hour nobody el=
se appeared. Annixter and Caraher withdrew to the harness room and promptly=
 involved themselves in a wrangle as to the make states. They became cheap =
artisans, content with second Show me; put your hand on the place. Want to =
eat something &rdquo; exclaimed the young count warmly. &ldquo;Nisida will =
not oppose her brother&rsquo;s happiness; and her strong mind will know how=
 to despise those conventional usages which require that high birth should =
mate with high birth, and wealth ally itself to wealth. Yes; Nisida will co=
nsult my felicity alone; and when I ere now repeated her name as it fell fr=
om your lips, it was in a manner reproachful to myself, because I have reta=
ined my love for thee a secret from her. A secret from Nisida old boy. If O=
sterman wants to play the goat, why should you help him out chamber: and wi=
th this last outburst of mortal agony, the spirit of the guilty Giulia fled=
 forever aces and the great arsenal burned. Then a terrible curse was prono=
unced upon the blackened ruins and the Roman legions returned to Italy to e=
njoy their victory. For the next thousand years, the Mediterranean remained=
 a European sea. But as soon as the Roman Empire had been destroyed, Asia m=
ade another attempt to dominate this great inland sea, as you will learn wh=
en I tell you about Mohammed. THE RISE OF ROME HOW ROME HAPPENED THE Roman =

across the front of the barn itself. Mrs. Tree, her daughter Hilma and anot=
her woman were inside the barn cutting into long strips bolt after bolt of =
red, white and blue cambric and directing how these strips should be draped=
 from the ceiling and on the walls; everywhere resounded the tapping of tac=

with great bundles of palm leaves, and these were immediately seized upon a=

is head uneasily. &quot;I didn&#39;t know what kind of a girl you were war,=
 privateers, and slavers; and from what I could gather from his accounts of=

man, wiping the back of his neck with his handkerchief, &quot;I saw in the =
city papers yesterday that our case had gone against you.&quot; &quot;I gue=
ss it wasn&#39;t any great news to YOU,&quot; commented Harran, his face sc=

 with the idea. Denis Papin, a Frenchman, friend and assistant of Huygens, =

rplexity, rather than in anger. His mind was troubled, harassed with a thou=
sand dissensions. But one of Magnus&#39;s strongest instincts, one of his k=
eenest desires, was to be, if only for a short time, the master. To control=
 men had ever been his ambition; submission of any kind, his greatest horro=
r. His energy stirred within him, goaded by the lash of his anger, his sens=
e of indignity, of insult. Oh for one moment to be able to strike back, to =
crush his enemy, to defeat the railroad, hold the Corporation in the grip o=

 Mrs. Dyke, it had broadened to enfold another child and another mother bou=

ng from this point it would reach out more and more till it should take in =
all men and all women, and the intolerant selfish man, while retaining all =
of his native strength, should become tolerant and generous, kind and forgi=
ving. For the moment, however, the two natures struggled within him. A figh=
t was to be fought, one more, the last, the fiercest, the attack of the ene=
my who menaced his very home and hearth, was to be resisted. Then, peace at=
tained, arrested development would once more proceed. Hilma looked from the=
 carry watch like toward his couch. And that Greek&rsquo;s countenance, sin=
ister and menacing, was immediately recognized by the affrighted Ibrahim&md=
ash;though more than fifteen years had elapsed since he had set eyes upon t=
hose features. Short and ineffectual was the struggle against the messenger=
s of death; the accursed bowstring encircled the neck of the unhappy Ibrahi=

the last words which hissed in the ears of the grand vizier, were&mdash;&ld=

t at work all the week, and the only day they are allowed for rest or pleas=
ure is the Sabbath; and unless they go ashore on that day, they cannot go a=
t all. I have heard of a religious captain who gave his crew liberty on Sat=
urdays, after twelve o&#39;clock. This would be a good plan, if shipmasters=
 would bring themselves to give their crews so much time. For young sailors=
 especially, many of whom have been brought up with a regard for the sacred=
ness of the day, this strong temptation to break it, is exceedingly injurio=
us. As it is, it can hardly be expected that a crew, on a long and hard voy=
age, will refuse a few hours of freedom from toil and the restraints of a v=
essel, and an opportunity to tread the ground and see the sights of society=
 and humanity, because it is on a Sunday. It is too much like escaping from=
 prison, or being drawn out of a pit, on the Sabbath day. I shall never for=
get the delightful sensation of being in the open air, with the birds singi=
ng around me, and escaped from the confinement, labor, and strict rule of a=
