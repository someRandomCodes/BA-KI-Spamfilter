ybody, murmured old Broderson, wagging his head, frowning perplexedly.  Mor=
eover, Salome exasperated Herod s cruelty against his sons; for Aristobulus=
 was desirous to bring her, who was his mother-in-law and his aunt, into th=

afety, and told her that the king was preparing to put her to death, on acc=
ount of the accusation that was laid against her, as if when she formerly e=
ndeavored to marry herself to Sylleus the Arabian, she had discovered the k=
ing s grand secrets to him, who was the king s enemy; and this it was that =
came as the last storm, and entirely sunk the young men when they were in g=
reat danger before.   And as one of those servants that attended him carrie=

nce of Claudian, Praefat.   See the note upon Antiq.   They had been hardy =
mariners and they had turned the AEgean into a center of commerce for the e=
xchange of goods between the highly civilised east and the slowly developin=
g wilderness of the European mainland.   Sozomen, l. viii.   That eminent l=
awyer of the Augustan age divided the year between the city and country, be=
tween business and composition; and four hundred books are enumerated as th=
e fruit of his retirement.  &ldquo;I require not thanks, my good friend,&rd=
quo; said Wagner.   Their honor was vindicated in the field of Tebeste, by =
the death of Solomon, and the total loss of his army. What remains?   He st=
