Scientists just discovered a common household item that fixes hemorrhoid pain, bleeding and itching... 

With a 100% success rate!

They also revealed that THIS is 3x better than Preparation-H... 

And it’s probably in your home right now.

So, which one do you think it is?

Is it…

1. Cinnamon Toothpaste
2. Cotton Swabs
3. Mint Nasal Spray 
4. Mouthwash + 1 tsp Shampoo

Take a guess, and tap on your answer...

Sincerely,

Randall

High waves along the shore decimated boats in the port of Sainte-Marie. The Roches Noires beach was completely submerged in water.[17] A fence and the northern access to an esplanade at the beach collapsed.[38] Significant portions of sand were washed away from the beach, exposing the foundations of the esplanade.[39] The MNS beach surveillance station and three masts used for signalling sustained damage. As a result, the lifeguard station was closed and rescues were no longer possible.[40][41] Tarpaulins covering crops on the Cisaille Plateau were ripped off. All the crops near Salazie were destroyed after 1,600 mm (63 in) of rain fell.[42] New crops planted after Cyclone Berguitta were destroyed, leading to shortages of fruits and vegetables.[43] Agricultural damage on Réunion was €3 million (US$3.73 million; equivalent to $4.03 million in 2021[44]).[45] Trees fell at two nursery schools in Saint-Denis.[36] A boil-water advisory was issued for Saint-Joseph. Portions of Salazie were left without potable water. In the municipality of Saint Benoit, interruptions in the water supply were expected by authorities following a power outage.[46] Low-lying areas in the Chaudron neighborhood, Sainte-Clotilde, flooded during the storm.[47] Temporary barriers in Tampon were stolen during the storm; the barriers were found in a ditch.[48] The Saint-Gilles port had to be unblocked as a result of debris and damage left behind.[17][30] Repair work on the Cilaos bridge was halted, due to severe conditions during the storm. Residents erected a temporary bridge using ladders to rescue 400 marooned people elsewhere in Cilaos and another 100 on a beach near Îlet Furçy.[49] A trail from Bois Court and Grand Bassin was closed as a result of damage inflicted by cyclones Berguitta and Dumazile. Cliff repair work was scheduled for March, with a planned reopening date in April.[50] The Dos d'Ane–Deux Bras hiking trail reopened on 17 July, after suffering damage during cyclones Berguitta, Dumazile, and Fakir.[51] The RN5 highway was impassable for months at Îlet Furçy, after cyclones Ava, Berguitta, and Dumazile caused several landslides. Work to rebuild two bridges damaged during the storm, a project costing around €100 million (US$121.1 million; equivalent to $130.68 million in 2021[44]), was halted after a prosecutor threatened criminal charges against officials for violating laws prohibiting circulating machinery from being in the Saint-Etienne river. Around 1,500 people protested the halt of the construction project.[52][53] The RN5 highway later reopened; multiple projects were proposed in December 2020 to further safeguard the highway fro
