Neurologist: “After 35+ years of treating nerve damage, I realized I was doing it wrong.”







which is the large area of thunderstorms surrounding the storm's circulation center. At the same time, Willa turned towards the northwest as it began traveling around the western edge of a mid-level ridge.[12] Environmental conditions around the cyclone and aloft were favorable, with very low wind shear, high levels of moisture, and sea surface temperatures of 84 °F (29 °C).[13] These conditions allowed Willa to strengthen into a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on October 21.[1] Around the storm, outflow became well-established, and in the center of the convection, a small eye developed.[14] Willa reached Category 3 status by 18:00 UTC, with its eye becoming well-defined on both infrared and satellite imagery, making it the tenth major hurricane of the season.[1][15] Continuing to rapidly intensify, Willa reached peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 925 mbar (27.3 inHg) at approximately 06:00 UTC on October 22, while located about 195 mi (314 km) south-southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico. This capped off a 48-hour period in which Willa's winds increased by 125 mph (201 km/h).[nb 2][1] Over the next few days, Willa recurved towards Mexico; the system turned to the north as it rounded the edge of the ridge and later to the northeast due to an approaching mid-to-upper-level trough.[15][17] Shortly after Willa reached peak intensity, microwave satellite imagery detected the presence of an outer eyewall, indicating that Willa was beginning to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle.[18][19] Willa also began to interact with the smaller Tropical Storm Vicente to the southeast at about this time.[20] Despite a favorable environment, Willa began to weaken due to the eyewall replacement cycle, with the storm's eye becoming cloud-filled;[1][21] Willa weakened to Category 3 strength on October 23 around 06:00 UTC, as southwesterly wind shear began to increase.[2
