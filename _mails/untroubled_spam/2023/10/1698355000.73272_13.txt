						<p><b style="font: 7.5px Lucida Handwriting; color: #463E3F;">His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.It took him a while to realize that everything he decided not to change, he was actually choosing.She tilted her head back and let whip cream stream into her mouth while taking a bath.For oil spots on the floor, nothing beats parking a motorbike in the lounge.He decided water-skiing on a frozen lake wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.Shingle color was not something the couple had ever talked about.Buried deep in the snow, he hoped his batteries were fresh in his avalanche beacon.I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but - I couldn&rsquo;t be any different to what my nickname was.I&#39;d rather be a bird than a fish.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.The group quickly understood that toxic waste was the most effective barrier to use against the zombies.In hopes of finding out the truth, he entered the one-room library.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.Pair your designer cowboy hat with scuba gear for a memorable occasion.He stomped on his fruit loops and thus became a cereal killer.Their argument could be heard across the parking lot.Jason didn&rsquo;t understand why his parents wouldn&rsquo;t let him sell his little sister at the garage .There can be too many cherries on an ice cream sundae.Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy everyone.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.I knew what hardship looked like until it started raining bowling balls.He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.The hand sanitizer was actually clear glue.He drank before spitting it out.She wasn&#39;t sure whether to be impressed or concerned that he folded underwear in neat little packages.Although it wasn&#39;t a pot of , Nancy was still enthralled at what she found at the end of the rainbow.That must be the tenth time I&#39;ve been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars.He had a wall full of masks so she could wear a different face every day.He was disappointed when he found the beach to be so sandy and the sun so sunny.The Guinea fowl flies through the air with the grace of a turtle.</b></p>
