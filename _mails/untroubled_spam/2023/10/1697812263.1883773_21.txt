rüning's economic policy from 1930 to 1932 has been the subject of much debate. It caused many Germans to identify the Republic with cuts in social spending and extremely liberal economics. Whether there were alternatives to this policy during the Great Depression is an open question. Franz von Papen, who was chancellor of Germany from 30 May to 17 November 1932, launched the Preußenschlag coup against the Social Democratic Party-led Government in the Free State of Prussia, which eliminated one of the last potential bastions of resistance to Hitler's seizure of power, considering the Free State of Prussia was home to the federal capital Berlin and had 61% of the Weimar Republic's population. Papen also pressured Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor and Papen as vice chancellor in 1933 in a cabinet ostensibly not under Nazi Party domination. Papen and his allies were quickly marginalized by Hitler, and he left the government after the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, during which the Nazis killed some of his allies and confidants, including Papen's successor and Hitler's predecessor, Kurt von Schleicher.[170][171] Paul von Hindenburg became Reichspräsident in 1925. As he was an old style monarchist conservative, he had little love lost for the Republic, but for the most part, he formally acted within the bounds of the constitution.[170] However, he ultimately—on the advice of his son and others close to him—appointed Hitler chancellor, thereby effectively ending the Republic after the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933. Additionally, Hindenburg's death in 1934 ended the last obstacle for Hitler to assume full power in the Weimar Republic. The German National People's Party (DNVP) has
