Halloween's origins are steeped in ancient traditions, tracing back over 2,=
000 years to the Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in), which was =
celebrated on the night of October 31st.  The Celts, who lived in the area =
that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France, believed that=
 on the eve of their new year, the boundary between the worlds of the livin=
g and the dead became blurred.  They thought that the ghosts of the dead re=
turned to earth, causing trouble and damaging crops.  Samhain was a time of=
 both fear and respect for the supernatural, a theme that has persisted in =
modern Halloween celebrations.  The festival of Samhain was marked by huge =
sacred bonfires, where people gathered to burn crops and animals as sacrifi=
ces to the Celtic deities.  During the celebration, the Celts wore costumes=
, typically consisting of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell eac=
h other's fortunes.  These early costumes and fortune-telling practices can=
 be seen as a direct antecedent to modern Halloween costumes and activities=
 such as trick-or-treating and bobbing for apples.  When the Roman Empire c=
onquered Celtic territories in the first century A. D. , two Roman festival=
s gradually blended with the traditional Celtic celebration of Samhain.  Th=
e first was Feralia, a day in late October when the Romans traditionally co=
mmemorated the passing of the dead.  The second was a day to honor Pomona, =
the Roman goddess of fruit and trees.  The symbol of Pomona is the apple, a=
nd the incorporation of this celebration into Samhain probably explains the=
 tradition of bobbing for apples that is practiced today on Halloween.  As =
Christianity spread into Celtic lands in the early Middle Ages, the church =
made efforts to replace pagan festivals with Christian holidays.  In 609 A.=
 D. , Pope Boniface IV established All Martyrs Day, which was later expande=
d by Pope Gregory III to include all saints as well as all martyrs, and mov=
ed from May 13 to November 1.  By the 9th century, the influence of Christi=
anity had spread into Celtic lands, where it gradually blended with and sup=
planted older Celtic rites.  In 1000 A. D. , the church made November 2 All=
 Souls=E2=80=99 Day, a day to honor the dead.  It=E2=80=99s widely believed=
 that the church was attempting to replace the Celtic festival of the dead =
with a related, church-sanctioned holiday.  All Souls' Day was celebrated s=
imilarly to Samhain, with big bonfires, parades, and dressing up in costume=
s as saints, angels, and devils.  The All Saints Day celebration was also c=
alled All-hallows or All-hallowmas (from Middle English Alholowmesse meanin=
g All Saints=E2=80=99 Day) and the night before it, the traditional night o=
f Samhain in the Celtic religion, began to be called All-Hallows Eve and, e=
ventually, Halloween.  As Europeans migrated to the New World, the traditio=
ns of Halloween came with them.  However, it wasn't until the mass Irish an=
d Scottish immigration during the 19th century that Halloween became widely=
 celebrated in America.  These immigrants brought with them their tradition=
s of carving jack-o=E2=80=99-lanterns and celebrating Halloween with games =
and festive gatherings.  The American Halloween tradition of "trick-or-trea=
ting" probably dates back to the early All Souls=E2=80=99 Day parades in En=
gland.  During the festivities, poor citizens would beg for food, and famil=
ies would give them pastries called =E2=80=9Csoul cakes=E2=80=9D in return =
for their promise to pray for the family=E2=80=99s dead relatives.  The dis=
tribution of soul cakes was encouraged by the church as a way to replace th=
e ancient practice of leaving food and wine for roaming spirits.  The pract=
ice, which was referred to as =E2=80=9Cgoing a-souling,=E2=80=9D was eventu=
ally taken up by children who would visit the houses in their neighborhood =
and be given ale, food, and money.  The tradition of dressing in costume fo=
r Halloween has both European and Celtic roots.  Hundreds of years ago, win=
ter was an uncertain and frightening time.  Food supplies often ran low, an=
d, for the many people afraid of the dark, the short days of winter were fu=
ll of constant worry.  On Halloween, when it was believed that ghosts came =
back to the earthly world, people thought that they would encounter ghosts =
if they left their homes.  To avoid being recognized by these ghosts, peopl=
e would wear masks when they left their homes after dark so that the ghosts=
 would mistake them for fellow spirits.  Today, Halloween is celebrated in =
numerous countries around the world.  In Mexico, Latin America, and Spain, =
All Souls=E2=80=99 Day, which is the third day of the Hallowmas, includes t=
he celebration of the traditional holiday D=C3=ADa de los Muertos (Day of t=
he Dead).  People decorate altars in their homes with candies, flowers, pho=
tographs, fresh water, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed=
, and visit graves with these as gifts.  The intent is to encourage visits =
by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the li=
ving directed to them.  Halloween=E2=80=99s global spread has seen the adop=
tion and adaptation of its customs, blending local traditions and cultural =
nuances, making it a truly diverse and ever-evolving celebration.=20

              <br />Halloween's origins are steeped in ancient traditions, =
tracing back over 2,000 years to the Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced=
 sow-in), which was celebrated on the night of October 31st. The Celts, who=
 lived in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern Fr=
ance, believed that on the eve of their new year, the boundary between the =
worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. They thought that the gho=
sts of the dead returned to earth, causing trouble and damaging crops. Samh=
ain was a time of both fear and respect for the supernatural, a theme that =
has persisted in modern Halloween celebrations. The festival of Samhain was=
 marked by huge sacred bonfires, where people gathered to burn crops and an=
imals as sacrifices to the Celtic deities. During the celebration, the Celt=
s wore costumes, typically consisting of animal heads and skins, and attemp=
ted to tell each other's fortunes. These early costumes and fortune-telling=
 practices can be seen as a direct antecedent to modern Halloween costumes =
and activities such as trick-or-treating and bobbing for apples. When the R=
oman Empire conquered Celtic territories in the first century A.D., two Rom=
an festivals gradually blended with the traditional Celtic celebration of S=
amhain. The first was Feralia, a day in late October when the Romans tradit=
ionally commemorated the passing of the dead. The second was a day to honor=
 Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and trees. The symbol of Pomona is the =
apple, and the incorporation of this celebration into Samhain probably expl=
ains the tradition of bobbing for apples that is practiced today on Hallowe=
en. As Christianity spread into Celtic lands in the early Middle Ages, the =
church made efforts to replace pagan festivals with Christian holidays. In =
609 A.D., Pope Boniface IV established All Martyrs Day, which was later exp=
anded by Pope Gregory III to include all saints as well as all martyrs, and=
 moved from May 13 to November 1. By the 9th century, the influence of Chri=
stianity had spread into Celtic lands, where it gradually blended with and =
supplanted older Celtic rites. In 1000 A.D., the church made November 2 All=
 Souls? Day, a day to honor the dead. It?s widely believed that the church =
was attempting to replace the Celtic festival of the dead with a related, c=
hurch-sanctioned holiday. All Souls' Day was celebrated similarly to Samhai=
n, with big bonfires, parades, and dressing up in costumes as saints, angel=
s, and devils. The All Saints Day celebration was also called All-hallows o=
r All-hallowmas (from Middle English Alholowmesse meaning All Saints? Day) =
and the night before it, the traditional night of Samhain in the Celtic rel=
igion, began to be called All-Hallows Eve and, eventually, Halloween. As Eu=
ropeans migrated to the New World, the traditions of Halloween came with th=
em. However, it wasn't until the mass Irish and Scottish immigration during=
 the 19th century that Halloween became widely celebrated in America. These=
 immigrants brought with them their traditions of carving jack-o?-lanterns =
and celebrating Halloween with games and festive gatherings. The American H=
alloween tradition of &quot;trick-or-treating&quot; probably dates back to =
the early All Souls? Day parades in England. During the festivities, poor c=
itizens would beg for food, and families would give them pastries called ?s=
oul cakes? in return for their promise to pray for the family?s dead relati=
ves. The distribution of soul cakes was encouraged by the church as a way t=
o replace the ancient practice of leaving food and wine for roaming spirits=
 The practice, which was referred to as ?going a-souling,? was eventually =
taken up by children who would visit the houses in their neighborhood and b=
e given ale, food, and money. The tradition of dressing in costume for Hall=
oween has both European and Celtic roots. Hundreds of years ago, winter was=
 an uncertain and frightening time. Food supplies often ran low, and, for t=
he many people afraid of the dark, the short days of winter were full of co=
nstant worry. On Halloween, when it was believed that ghosts came back to t=
he earthly world, people thought that they would encounter ghosts if they l=
eft their homes. To avoid being recognized by these ghosts, people would we=
ar masks when they left their homes after dark so that the ghosts would mis=
take them for fellow spirits. Today, Halloween is celebrated in numerous co=
untries around the world. In Mexico, Latin America, and Spain, All Souls? D=
ay, which is the third day of the Hallowmas, includes the celebration of th=
e traditional holiday D&iacute;a de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). People d=
ecorate altars in their homes with candies, flowers, photographs, fresh wat=
er, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visit graves =
with these as gifts. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the=
 souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to the=
m. Halloween?s global spread has seen the adoption and adaptation of its cu=
stoms, blending local traditions and cultural nuances, making it a truly di=
verse and ever-evolving celebration.              </div> </td>=20
