Why Conventional Preparedness Wisdom Will Get You Killed - A US Army Officer's Field Guide to Surviving a New Civil War

There's a division in America so extreme it's hard to see a way back. Whether it's left vs. right, race - or religion. It's never been like this...

http://www.painbreakthorugback.shop/l/lt7R33294A1664AB/3372Q15980TS25322EK986GI589167226O3264357463

According to a Gallup 77% of Americans believe our country is irreversibly divided

Including...

A Surge in Left-Wing Terrorism - with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise as the latest victim of a rise in political assassinations since the Trump-administration took power.

Violent Race Riots: that have caused over $5 billion in damages since 2010, engulfing even small towns like Ferguson in 2015, resulting in 321 arrests, in a town of just 20,000 people!

A Liberal vs. Conservative Culture War: that's near-identical to the buildup of every major civil war in history. With each viewing the other as vermin... Increasing the chances a civil conflict will spread like wildfire...

Believe me. I've seen it before...

1995 Plain Speaking became the focus of a controversy. Robert H. Ferrell, a historian who had also published a biography of Truman, asserted that Miller had fabricated many of the quotes in his book.[16][17] In Plain Speaking, Miller quoted Truman as referring to General Douglas MacArthur as a "dumb-son-of-a-bitch" and quoted Truman as asserting that Dwight Eisenhower, his successor in the Oval Office, tried to divorce his wife Mamie in order to marry Kay Summersby, his English chauffeur and secretary during World War II. In Miller's recounting, Truman claimed that General George C. Marshall wrote Eisenhower a letter threatening to ruin his career if he divorced his wife. According to Ferrell, Truman never actually said any of this,[18] and he accused Miller of simply making up Truman's quotes to make his book more interesting and lively. A similar issue occurred with comments that Miller claimed Truman said about his former attorney general and later Supreme Court appointee, Justice Tom C. Clark.[19] Ferrell claimed that Miller's papers on file in the Truman presidential library include no references to a number of Truman's quotes in Plain Speaking, and in his opinion the quotes are most likely forgeries created by Miller, and are not real Truman quotes or statements. Ferrell also noted that Miller waited until nearly two years after Truman's death to publish Plain Speaking. In 1963 Truman wrote a letter to Miller which read: "I thank you for sending me the article which you [Miller] proposed for the Saturday Evening Post. I am not in favor of such articles, especially this one which has so many misstatements of fact in it. I am sorry that that is the case and if you publish it I shall make that statem
