From the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through language contact into Middle English. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200 to 1450.

First, the waves of Norse (Viking) colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. The centre of norsified English was in the Midlands around Lindsey. After 920 CE, when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, English spread extensively throughout the region. An element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the pronoun group beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera). Other core Norse loanwords include "give", "get", "sky", "skirt", "egg", and "cake", typically displacing a native Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Old Norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of Old English, particularly northern ones.

With the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the now-Norsified Old English language was subject to another wave of intense contact, this time with Old French, in particular Old Norman French. Old Norman French in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman. Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking English, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains. Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reco

<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far from being a harmless nuisance, tinnitus has been linked to </span><strong>memory loss, hearing loss and dementia&hellip;</strong></p>

<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But did you know it actually</span><strong> physically </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">wipes 1% of your memories every month,</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>attacking the brain in the most violent way</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>

<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forcing it to endure that constant ringing leads to the widespread death of your neurons, most of which are located in key areas of your brain such as your hippocampus.</span></p>

<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s the part of your brain that&rsquo;s tasked with forming and storing episodic memories.</span></p>

<p style="font-family:verdana; font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without it, </span><strong>you will be unable to create new memories with your family or friends.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
