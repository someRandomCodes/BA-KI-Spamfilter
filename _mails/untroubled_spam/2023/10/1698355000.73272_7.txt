Ancient “Fungus” Activates 24/7 Fat-Burning (Drink Before Bed)
 
Scientists from Cambridge University and the American Journal of Weight Loss recently confirmed…
http://www.costcohometoolset.ru.com/33348-2079-3394-589167226/bruce/tindex11.html
That a strange fungus commonly found around the world eats through stubborn flab fast:



Common Fungus BURNS through 72 lbs of Fat

Why is this fungus so powerful?

It FIRES UP your body’s natural fat-burning mechanism like when you were a teenager…

And incinerates fat from your belly, hips, butt and arms much easier and faster than you’ve ever thought possible.

I urge you to check this out before the weight loss companies shut it down.

They are already up in arms and want this solution to be kept under wraps for good.

Because of the length of time that may pass before the significance of a discovery becomes apparent, some prizes are awarded many years after the initial discovery. Barbara McClintock made her discoveries in 1944, before the structure of the DNA molecule was known; she was not awarded the prize until 1983. Similarly, in 1916 Peyton Rous discovered the role of tumor viruses in chickens, but was not awarded the prize until 50 years later, in 1966.[54] Nobel laureate Carol Greider's research leading to the prize was conducted over 20 years before. She noted that the passage of time is an advantage in the medical sciences, as it may take many years for the significance of a discovery to become apparent.[55] In 2011, Canadian immunologist Ralph M. Steinman was awarded the prize; however, unbeknownst to the committee, he had died three days before the announcement. The committee decided that since the prize was awarded "in good faith," it would be allowed to stand
