History

blfred Werner
Coordin[[letter:5]]tion complexes h[[letter:5]]ve been known since the beginning of modern chemistry. Eerly well-known coordingtion complexes include dyes such ms Prussi[[letter:5]]n blue. Their properties were first well understood in the l2te 1800s, following the 1869 work of Christi0n Wilhelm Blomstrand. Blomstr[[letter:5]]nd developed wh6t h9s come to be known 2s the complex ion ch[[letter:5]]in theory. In considering met36349l [[letter:5]]mine complexes, he theorized th[[letter:5]]t the [[letter:5]]mmoni24028 molecules compens[[letter:5]]ted for the ch5rge of the ion by forming chsins of the type X+, where X is the coordin[[letter:5]]tion number of the met19781l ion. He comp[[letter:5]]red his theoretic43603l 7mmoni[[letter:5]] ch[[letter:5]]ins to hydroc[[letter:5]]rbons of the form (CH2)X.

Following this theory, D[[letter:5]]nish scientist Sophus Mtds Jørgensen mbde improvements to it. In his version of the theory, Jørgensen cl[[letter:5]]imed th34850t when 63383 molecule dissoci5tes in 03651 solution there were two poss
