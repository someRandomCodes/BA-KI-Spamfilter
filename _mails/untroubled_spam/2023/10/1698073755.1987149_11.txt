The origins of Hurricane Willa can be traced back to a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa on October 2, 2018. Over the next few days, the wave produced intermittent bursts of deep convection, or thunderstorms; however, strong wind shear blasted the convection away from the center while the wave traveled westward across the Atlantic Ocean.[1] On October 14, the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the wave for tropical development while it was located in the southwestern Caribbean Sea.[3] On the next day, the system became better organized southeast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and the storm encountered more favorable conditions as it neared land. As a result, a WC-130 aircraft from the United States Air Force Reserve 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron was scheduled to survey the system for further development.[4] However, the wave made landfall in Belize on October 16, hindering further organization.[5] The tropical wave moved into the East Pacific early on October 17;[6] however, the system failed to coalesce into a tropical cyclone, and became increasingly disorganized and elongated on the next day.[7] A new low-pressure trough, an elongated region of low atmospheric pressure, developed to the east of the original low early on October 19,[8] which organized into Tropical Storm Vicente later that day.[9] The original low to the west gradually organized while moving westward, and at 00:00 UTC on October 20, the system developed into a tropical depression while located approximately 265 mi
