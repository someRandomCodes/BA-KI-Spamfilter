Hi.
I have very bad news for you. Unfortunately, your private data was =
compromised.

Your password was compromised through a legitimate website, and that led =
to events that I will explain to you now.
Using your password, our team gained access to your email. We analyzed =
all data and after going through found a vector for an attack.
That attack was a success. The result was that your machine was infected =
with a virus/backdoor. Our team uses individual approach to every =
victim, our success rate is very high.

We have gained access to the data, but the most interesting part that we =
are able to control your webcam and microphone.=20

And you are correct. We have a nice archive with exploding video =
content.
It's all good, but we are here to make money. So if you don't want those =
videos to be leaked, please follow the instructions.

You pay $750 USD, and there will be nothing to worry about. No chats, no =
photos, nothing. Every single file will be deleted and virus removed =
from your machine

Use Bitcoin to make the transfer. Wallet address is =
1J7RYCYp8D7zYoAAR4HQDXujaRU6D9tDbf , it's unique and we will know that =
you made the payment immediately.
You have 2 days to make the transfer, that's reasonable.
Take care.
