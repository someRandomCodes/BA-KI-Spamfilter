In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after =
Price declined an offer from Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehou=
se store chain, Sam's Club. 25 Costco's business model and size were simila=
r to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both compa=
nies. 11 The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships be=
came universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership=
 to shop at Costco and vice versa.  PriceCostco boasted 206 locations gener=
ating $16 billion in annual sales. 13 PriceCostco was initially led by exec=
utives from both companies, but in 1994, the Prices left the company to for=
m PriceSmart,1126 a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbe=
an unrelated to the current Costco Costco moved its headquarters from Kirkl=
and to Issaquah in 1996; it chose to build a new headquarters campus next t=
o a warehouse store to allow buyers to check sales and merchandise. 28 They=
 had originally planned to move by December 1993 to Redmond, another Eastsi=
de city, but delays in road construction near the warehouse site caused the=
 company to reconsider. 29 The former Kirkland headquarters, a 10. 7-acre (=
4. 3 ha) campus, was sold in late 1996 The company began testing store conv=
ersions to Costco branding across the Southwestern United States in late 19=
96.  It officially reverted to using the Costco name and stock symbol in Fe=
bruary 1997, with all remaining Price Club locations subsequently rebranded=
 as Costco. 3132 Other company milestones The first Costco warehouse in Sea=
ttle was replaced with a new building on an adjacent lot to the north in Ma=
rch 2005;33 the company was able to arrange to keep the same address for th=

8 Costco announced the opening of 29 new locations in 2016, the most in one=
 year since 2007. 3940 Span Construction, led by King Husein, has construct=
ed almost all of Costco's buildings since 1989. 41 Costco opened its first =
warehouse in China on August 27, 2019, in Shanghai.  The store's opening ga=
rnered much attention, which led to its opening day being cut short over sa=
fety concerns. 42 The first Costco in New Zealand was first opened at West =
Auckland in September 2022,4344 delayed from mid-August due to the economic=
 impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 45 Costco today In the United States, Cos=

/><br /><br />In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations the=
mselves after Price declined an offer from Walmart to merge Price Club with=
 their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.25 Costco's business model and siz=
e were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural f=
or both companies.11 The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and me=
mberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use thei=
r membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 loca=
tions generating $16 billion in annual sales.13 PriceCostco was initially l=
ed by executives from both companies, but in 1994, the Prices left the comp=
