The Report examined the rate of decline in biodiversity and found that the adverse effects of human activities on the world's species is "unprecedented in human history":[14] one million species, including 40 percent of amphibians, almost a third of reef-building corals, more than a third of marine mammals, and 10 percent of all insects are threatened with extinction.[15] This is out of an estimated 8 million animal and plant species, including 5.5 million insect species. The drivers of these extinctions are, in descending order: (1) changes in land and sea use; (2) direct exploitation of organisms; (3) climate change; (4) pollution and (5) invasive alien species.[6] Since the 16th century, at least 680 species of vertebrates have become extinct.[16] By 2016, among mammals, more than nine percent of livestock breeds were extinct, and another 1,000 breeds are threatened with extinction.[17] The authors have coined the expression "dead species walking" for the more than 500,000 species that are not yet extinct but, due to changes in, or reduction of, their habitats, have no chance of long-term survival.[18] A 2002 satellite image showing deforestation due to palm oil farming in Malaysian Borneo. According to the Report, the threat to species diversity is human-caused.[19] The main cause is the human land requirement, which deprives other species of their habitats.[10] In the past 50 years, the world's human population has doubled,[20][12] per capita gross domestic product has quadrupled,[21] and biodiversity has suffered a catastrophic decline.[22] Most notably, tropical forests have been cleared for cattle pastures i
