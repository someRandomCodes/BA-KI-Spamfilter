			<h2 style="text-align: left;">Typical vacuum cleaners are heavy, hard to maneuver and store, and expensive.<br />


			Lighter vacuums often lack suction power and may break easily.<br />


			<br />


			Investing in a lighter vacuum is important but one must consider their cleaning needs and make sure the vacuum is powerful enough and has enough capacity.<br />


			<br />


			Effective vacuuming, especially of non-typical areas like your couch, car, mattress, and office is crucial for good home hygiene and overall health.</h2>
