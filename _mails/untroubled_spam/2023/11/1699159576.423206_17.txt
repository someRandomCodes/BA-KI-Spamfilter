"It was super fun to use. We were gone for four nights, and didn't have to get ice at all. Not having to deal with ice the whole time was amazing. I was worried that it wasn't big enough. But it held absolutely everything I was planning to take because I didn't have to put any ice in there. It didn't have to be as big as my regular cooler."

Randy M. 5 Stars
"You cannot beat it. It is awesome. No running around, looking for drinks. No more opening up your drink and setting it on the tractor and coming back 20 minutes later and it's warm. Everything's cold. Everything's cold all the time. Just a wonderful, wonderful unit. I am a Type 1 diabetic. It's been keeping my insulin cold to the point where I don't worry about my insulin. I know it's good."

Damon H. 5 Stars
"We all have lots of coolers. But this is a cooler extraordinaire. Not only is it a cooler, it's a fully-functioning refrigerator. It's great for me being a fisherman and an outdoor guy. I can put a bunch of fish in here and set it at freezing temperatures. And when I get home, my fish will stay frozen and I don't need any ice. It's a great tool. It's absolutely a must for campers and fisherman. It looks like a cooler, but it's actually a refrigerator which makes it a really special thing."

Lisa W. 5 Stars
"You don't have to stop and get ice anymore. That was one thing I hated to do early in the morning when we had to leave to go out of town to play in a baseball tournament. We had to leave at 5 or 6 or sometimes 4:30 in the morning and had to stop to get ice for our cooler. So this is nice because you just have to set it on refrigerator mode and you get your cold drinks or whatever you put in your cooler. People are already taking pictures with it, trying to find out more information so they could get their own."

Lou H. 5 Stars
"Please get one or two of them like I did. They will come in handy next time you have a power failure or going on a trip. I use mine whenever we travel or recently when we had a power failure a few weeks ago. You won't be sorry."

rown pelican is part of a clade that includes the Peruvian pelican (P. thagus) and American white pelican (P. erythrorhynchos); brown and Peruvian pelicans are sister taxa, with American white pelican a more distant relative.[5] The Peruvian pelican was previously considred a subspecies of the brown pelican, but is now considered a separate species on the basis of its much greater size (around double the weight of the brown pelican), differences in bill color and plumage, and a lack of evidence of hybridization between the forms where their ranges approach and overlap.[3] (In captivity, the brown pelican is known to have hybridized with both the American white pelican and the more distantly related great white pelican.[13]) In 1932, James L. Peters divided Pelecanus into three subgenera, placing brown pelican (including Peruvian pelican) in a monospecific Leptopelicanus, American white pelican in a monospecific Cyrtopelicanus, and all the rest in the subgenus Pelecanus, a treatment which was also followed by Jean Dorst and Raoul J. Mougin in 1979. Andrew Elliott in 1992, and Joseph B. Nelson in 2005, considered the deepest division among pelicans to lie between brown (plus Peruvian) pelican on the one hand, and the white-plumaged pelicans on the other (among which the large ground-nesting American white, Australian, great white, and Dalmatian pelicans were thought to form a clade, and the smaller tree-nesting pink-backed and spot-billed pelicans were likewise considered sister taxa). In 1993, Paul Johnsgard hypothesized that the Americas were colonized relatively late in pelican evolution, with the family originating in Africa or South Asia; however, he later supported the prevailing view that brown (with Peruvian) was the most divergent pelican (and considered American white and great white pelicans to be close relatives, implying two independent dispersals of pelicans into the Americas, with that of the ancestor of brown and Peruvian pelicans occurring early on). Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridization studies and UPGMA tree published in 1990 supported brown pelican as sister to a clade comprising all the white-plumaged pelicans analyzed, including American white pelican (although the relationships among the latter group diff

Everything's cold. Everything's cold all the time. Just a wonderful, wonderful unit. I am a Type 1 diabetic. It's been keeping my insulin cold to the point where I don't worry about my insulin. I know it's good."</p>

        "We all have lots of coolers. But this is a cooler extraordinaire. Not only is it a cooler, it's a fully-functioning refrigerator. It's great for me being a fisherman and an outdoor guy. I can put a bunch of fish in here and set it at freezing temperatures. And when I get home, my fish will stay frozen and I don't need any ice. It's a great tool. It's absolutely a must for campers and fisherman. It looks like a cooler, but it's actually a refrigerator which makes it a really special thing."</p>

        "You don't have to stop and get ice anymore. That was one thing I hated to do early in the morning when we had to leave to go out of town to play in a baseball tournament. We had to leave at 5 or 6 or sometimes 4:30 in the morning and had to stop to get ice for our cooler. So this is nice because you just have to set it on refrigerator mode and you get your cold drinks or whatever you put in your cooler. People are already taking pictures with it, trying to find out more information so they could get their own."</p>

<p style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:6px;">rown pelican is part of a clade that includes the Peruvian pelican (P. thagus) and American white pelican (P. erythrorhynchos); brown and Peruvian pelicans are sister taxa, with American white pelican a more distant relative.[5] The Peruvian pelican was previously considred a subspecies of the brown pelican, but is now considered a separate species on the basis of its much greater size (around double the weight of the brown pelican), differences in bill color and plumage, and a lack of evidence of hybridization between the forms where their ranges approach and overlap.[3] (In captivity, the brown pelican is known to have hybridized with both the American white pelican and the more distantly related great white pelican.[13])

In 1932, James L. Peters divided Pelecanus into three subgenera, placing brown pelican (including Peruvian pelican) in a monospecific Leptopelicanus, American white pelican in a monospecific Cyrtopelicanus, and all the rest in the subgenus Pelecanus, a treatment which was also followed by Jean Dorst and Raoul J. Mougin in 1979. Andrew Elliott in 1992, and Joseph B. Nelson in 2005, considered the deepest division among pelicans to lie between brown (plus Peruvian) pelican on the one hand, and the white-plumaged pelicans on the other (among which the large ground-nesting American white, Australian, great white, and Dalmatian pelicans were thought to form a clade, and the smaller tree-nesting pink-backed and spot-billed pelicans were likewise considered sister taxa). In 1993, Paul Johnsgard hypothesized that the Americas were colonized relatively late in pelican evolution, with the family originating in Africa or South Asia; however, he later supported the prevailing view that brown (with Peruvian) was the most divergent pelican (and considered American white and great white pelicans to be close relatives, implying two independent dispersals of pelicans into the Americas, with that of the ancestor of brown and Peruvian pelicans occurring early on). Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridization studies and UPGMA tree published in 1990 supported brown pelican as sister to a clade comprising all the white-plumaged pelicans analyzed, including American white pelican (although the relationships among the latter group diff</p>
