<p><b style="font: 9.5px Mongolian Baiti; color: #5C5858;">Tody arrived with a crash of my car through the garage door.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.She was made the society president because she can whistle with her toes.The reservoir water level continued to lower while we enjoyed our long shower.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.After fighting the alligator, Brian still had to face the anaconda.She wasn&#39;t sure whether to be impressed or concerned that he folded underwear in neat little packages.The bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny&#39;s head by mere millimeters.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.100 years old is such a young age if you happen to be a bristlecone pine.She was too busy always talking about what she wanted to do to actually do any of it.I hear that Nancy is very pretty.She looked at the masterpiece hanging in the museum but she could think is that her five-year-old could do better.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.When he asked her favorite number, she answered without hesitation that it was diamonds.She did her best to help him.He drank before spitting it out.Let me help you with your baggage.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.There was coal in his stocking and he was thrilled.He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neighbor&#39;s yard.I was offended by the suggestion that my baby brother was a jewel thief.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Boulders lined the side of the road foretelling what could come next.It&#39;s always a good idea to seek shelter from the evil gaze of the sun.The family&rsquo;s excitement over going to Disneyland was crazier than she anticipated.The efficiency with which he paired the socks in the drawer was quite admirable.He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he&#39;d used until then.Waffles are always better without fire ants and fleas.Potato wedges probably are not best for relationships.</b></p>
