<p style=3D"position:absolute;visibility:hidden;">ew World sparrows are a g=
roup of mainly New World passerine birds, forming the family Passerellidae.=
 They are seed-eating birds with conical bills, brown or gray in color, and=
 many species have distinctive head patterns.

Although they share the name sparrow, New World sparrows are more closely r=
elated to Old World buntings than they are to the Old World sparrows (famil=
y Passeridae).[1][2] New World sparrows are also similar in both appearance=
 and habit to finches, with which they sometimes used to be classified.

Taxonomy
The genera now assigned to the family Passerellidae were previously include=

uclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2015 found that the Pas=
serellidae formed a monophyletic group that had an uncertain relationship t=
o the Emberizidae.[3] Emberizidae was therefore split and the family Passer=
ellidae resurrected.[4][5] It had originally been introduced, as the subfam=
ily Passerellinae, by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1851.[6]
