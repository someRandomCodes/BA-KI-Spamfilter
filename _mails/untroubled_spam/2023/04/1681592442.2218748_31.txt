<p> We refitted the whole house, you know.   The untamed spirit of the Barb=
arians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular discipline.   Th=
e emperor Honorius was distinguished, above his subjects, by the preeminenc=
e of fear, as well as of rank.   Mucianus came also, who was the president =
of the province, and told him with what alacrity the people received the ne=
ws of his advancement , and how the people of every city had taken the oath=
 of fidelity to him.   The Greek historian is himself so confounded by the =
wonders which he relates, that he weakly attempts to distinguish the island=
s of Britia and Britain, which he has identified by so many inseparable cir=
cumstances.   The emperor Frederic III.  - xxx.   &ldquo;&lsquo;My happines=
s depends upon you,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;in the name of Heaven keep me=
 not in suspense; but tell me, can you and will you be mine?&rsquo; &ldquo;=
&lsquo;I could be thine, but I dare not,&rsquo; she replied, in a voice sca=
rcely audible.   In a short time they had turned into the County Road by th=
e great watering-tank, and proceeded onward in the shade of the interminabl=
e line of poplar trees, the wind- break that stretched along the roadside b=
ordering the Broderson ranch.   A man, evidently some sort of manager s ass=
istant, stood at the end of the table, leaning on the back of one of the ch=
airs.   The slow and stately procession in which he showed himself to the p=
rostrate crowd, was changed to a rapid and secret journey; and the first ev=
ening he lodged in the cottage of a peasant, whose humble door would scarce=
ly give admittance to the great king.  There were few women in the throng, =
but hardly a single male inhabitant of either Bonneville or Guadalajara was=
 absent.   Write to me from Honolulu, and bon voyage.   While at dinner, th=
e cook called, Sail ho!   It was within the inclosure of the seraglio that =
Alessandro Francatelli, whom we shall henceforth call by his apostate name =
of Ibrahim&mdash;was lodged in the dwelling of the reis- effendi or ministe=
r of foreign affairs.  My own grandfather did this and Heaven knows he was =
not born to be a hero.   Footnote *: According to Ducas, one of the Afabi b=
eat out his eye with a stone Compare Von Hammer.   You poor, dear poet, you=
 are thin as a ghost.   On the death of his master he joined the standard o=
f Theodosius; contributed, by his valor and military conduct, to the destru=
ction of the tyrant; and was appointed, after the victory, master- general =
of the armies of Gaul.   Some places they burnt down, some they utterly dem=
olished, and whatsoever grew in the country, they either trod it down or fe=
d upon it, and by their marches they made the ground that was cultivated ha=
rder and more untractable than that which was barren. </p>=0D
