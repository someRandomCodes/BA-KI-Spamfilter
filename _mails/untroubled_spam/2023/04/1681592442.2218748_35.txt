<p> It was probably the duty, or at least the interest, of Renatus, to magnify the virtues of Aetius; but he would have shown more dexterity if he had not insisted on his patient, forgiving disposition.   One of the lads who came in his boat, a thoroughly countrified-looking fellow, seemed to care very little about the vessel, rigging, or anything else, but went round looking at the live stock, and leaned over the pig-sty, and said he wished he was back again tending his father s pigs.  The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved images and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between the outspread arms of a kindly saint.   I want to make this the best etext edition possible for both scholars and the general public.   The gates were thrown open on their approach, the streets on both sides were lined with the battle axes of the Danish and English guard: the presence-chamber glittered with gold and jewels, the false substitute of virtue and power: by the side of the blind Isaac his wife was seated, the sister of the king of Hungary: and by her appearance, the noble matrons of Greece were drawn from their domestic retirement, and mingled with the circle of senators and soldiers.

Well, why not HAVE a Railroad Commission of our own, then?   &ldquo;Yes, yes; there is another terrible memorial!&rdquo; cried the stranger.  The same policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs, and, according to the harsh metaphor of Tertullian, the gloomy and intricate forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and constitutions.
