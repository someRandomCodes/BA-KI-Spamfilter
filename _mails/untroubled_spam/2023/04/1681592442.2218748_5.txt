<p><span style="font-size:20px;">My friend Sharon just lost 34 pounds, SEVENTEEN of those in the first few weeks... right after she started this simple morning routine...</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Prior to this, nothing worked for her... at best she&#39;d lose weight one week, just to gain it back the next.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:20px;">But when she started&nbsp;doing THIS every morning, things rapidly shifted...</span></p>

From the ruins of the Byzantine libraries, from the darkest monasteries of Germany and Britain, he collected the dusty manuscripts of the writers of antiquity; and wherever the original could not be removed, a faithful copy was transcribed and transmitted for his use.

Be not terrified, said the intrepid Heraclius, by the multitude of your foes.   Prostrate on the ground, he deplored with tears and groans the guilt of his past rebellion; nor would he presume to arise, unless some faithful subject would drag him to the foot of the throne, by an iron chain with which he had secretly encircled his neck.
