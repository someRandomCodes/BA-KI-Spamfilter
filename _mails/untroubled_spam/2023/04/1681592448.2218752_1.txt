A notable adventure game released in 1983 was Planet Mephius, authored by Eiji Yokoyama and published by T&E Soft for the FM-7 in July 1983.[138] In addition to being one of the earliest titles to use a command menu system,[139] its key innovation was the introduction of a point-and-click interface to the genre, utilizing a cursor to interact with objects displayed on the screen, albeit the cursor utilizing primitive keyboard controls instead of a mouse.[138] A similar point-and-click cursor interface was later used in the adventure game Wingman,[140] released for the PC-8801 in 1984.[citation needed] The NES version of Portopia Serial Murder Case was released in 1985 and became a major hit in Japan, where it sold over 700,000 copies.[141] With no keyboard, the NES version, developed by Chunsoft, replaced the text parser of the original with a command selection menu list. It also featured a cursor that can be moved on the screen using the D-pad to look for clues and hotspots, like a point-and-click interface.[126] In 1986, Square released the science fiction adventure game Suishō no Dragon for the NES console. The game featured the use of animation in many of the scenes rather than still images or sprites,[142] which was unusual at the time for a console game, and an interface resembling that of a point-and-click interface for a console, like Portopia on the NES, but making use of visual icons rather than text-based ones. That same year saw the release of J.B. Harold Murder Club,[143] a graphic adventure,[144] for the PC-98.[143] It featured character interaction as the major gameplay element and has been compared to more recent titles such as Shenmue and Shadow of Memories as well as the role-playing game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.[144] The TurboGrafx-CD port of J.B. Harold Murder Club was one of the first Japanese adventure games released in the
