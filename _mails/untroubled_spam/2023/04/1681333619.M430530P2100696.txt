<p> Of murder!&mdash;and it was hinted, when last I stood before your emine=
nce, that the Jews have been known to slay Christian children as an offerin=
g to Heaven.   During the season of sincere grief, or ostentatious mourning=
, the Eastern emperor was interrupted by the arrival of the principal chamb=
erlain of Maximus; and the choice of a venerable old man, for an office whi=
ch was usually exercised by eunuchs, announced to the court of Constantinop=
le the gravity and temperance of the British usurper.   At these animating =
words, the Turks would instantly fly, and the victorious Romans would drive=
 them from the West, and from all Anatolia as far as the frontiers of Persi=
a.   I never answered a question from him, or advanced an opinion to him, w=
ithout thinking more than once.  there came a stone out of one of the engin=
es, and smote him, and killed him immediately; and as he was uttering the v=
ery same presages he gave up the ghost.   In the pride of conquest, Touran =
Shaw, the last of his race, was murdered by his Mamalukes; and the most dar=
ing of the assassins entered the chamber of the captive king, with drawn ci=
meters, and their hands imbrued in the blood of their sultan.   The two bro=
thers soon emerged into favor and action, fought by each other s side again=
st the rebels and Barbarians, and adhered to the emperor Michael, till he w=
as deserted by the world and by himself.   They voluntarily chose to reduce=
 the citizens to that extremity, as to force mothers to this unnatural barb=
arity, which, in all its circumstances, has not, I still suppose, been hith=
erto paralleled among the rest of mankind.   But on the approach of Mahomet=
 himself all was silent and prostrate: he first halted at the distance of f=
ive miles; and from thence advancing in battle array, planted before the ga=
tes of St. Romanus the Imperial standard; and on the sixth day of April for=
med the memorable siege of Constantinople.   Now as to John, what advantage=
 he had above Eleazar in the multitude of his followers, the like disadvant=
age he had in the situation he was in, since he had his enemies over his he=
ad; and as he could not make any assault upon them without some terror, so =
was his anger too great to let them be at rest; nay, although he suffered m=
ore mischief from Eleazar and his party than he could inflict upon them, ye=
t would he not leave off assaulting them, insomuch that there were continua=
l sallies made one against another, as well as darts thrown at one another,=
 and the temple was defiled every where with murders. </p>=0D
