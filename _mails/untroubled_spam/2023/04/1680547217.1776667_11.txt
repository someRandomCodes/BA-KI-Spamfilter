<p> &ldquo;If thou wast guilty in abandoning one who loved thee so tenderly=
, and whose earthly reliance was on thee, he, whom you did so abandon, has =
not the less need to ask pardon of thee.   The untamed spirit of the Barbar=
ians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular discipline.   The =
ministers of Honorius were heard to declare, that, if they had only in voke=
d the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust th=
eir souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of =
the emperor himself; they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himse=
lf; they had touched, in solemn ceremony, that august seat of majesty and w=
isdom; and the violation of their oath would exposethem to the temporal pen=
alties of sacrilege and rebellion.  This floor was on an even height with t=
he roof of the church, and it was used as a storeroom.   But what will be t=
he effect of that alarm which you have rung?&rdquo; &ldquo;Merely to warn t=
hose above that something unusual is taking place below,&rdquo; answered th=
e old woman.   The emperor Frederic III.   Have you depended on your multit=
ude, while a very small part of the Roman soldiery have been strong enough =
for you?   &ldquo;&lsquo;My happiness depends upon you,&rsquo; I answered; =
&lsquo;in the name of Heaven keep me not in suspense; but tell me, can you =
and will you be mine?&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;I could be thine, but I dare not=
,&rsquo; she replied, in a voice scarcely audible.   For an instant, Annixt=
er stood awkwardly in his place, ridiculous, clumsy, murmuring over and ove=
r again: Well--well--that s all right--who s going to hurt you?   Stilicho =
escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goths and, after issuing a la=
st and generous admonition to the cities of Italy, to shut their gates agai=
nst the Barbarians, his confidence, or his despair, urged him to throw hims=
elf into Ravenna, which was already in the absolute possession of his enemi=
es.   A light conjecture.   There are but few of these families in Californ=
ia; being mostly those in official stations, or who, on the expiration of t=
heir offices, have settled here upon property which they have acquired; and=
 others who have been banished for state offences.   The adulteries of the =
African soldiers are checked by one of the Imperial laws.  Haec multos lace=
ra suscepit ab urbe fugates, Hic fessis posito certa timore salus.   The cr=
owd has gone wild out there.   But the official business of the state was d=
iligently and faithfully transacted by the quaestor Proclus; ^5 and the age=
d emperor adopted the talents and ambition of his nephew Justinian, an aspi=
ring youth, whom his uncle had drawn from the rustic solitude of Dacia, and=
 educated at Constantinople, as the heir of his private fortune, and at len=
gth of the Eastern empire.   Footnote *: According to Ducas, one of the Afa=
bi beat out his eye with a stone Compare Von Hammer.   The death of Manuel,=
 and the disorders of the minority, soon opened the fairest field to his am=
bition.   As long as the factions were divided, the triumphant blues, and d=
esponding greens, appeared to behold with the same indifference the disorde=
rs of the state.   returned the other, willing to take it as a joke. </p>=0D
