Hi,

More and more Americans are finally getting rid of toenails fungus COMPLETELY.

They’re doing this thanks to an African tribe’s incredible and well-kept secret that is able to destroy any fungal infection.

The entire medical community is in utter shock because of it...

Especially considering the fact that the people who invented this breakthrough ritual have never seen, touched, let alone used fancy creams, antifungal drugs or even common everyday soap their entire lives.

THIS article is going to show how simple it actually is to get rid of any contagious fungal infection fast and natural without any dangerous side effects.

The African trick is as cheap as it is simple and efficient, and no matter how yellow, itchy or smelly your toes are right now, it is guaranteed to easily flush away all the fungus in your body.

After months of surgeries, laser treatments and expensive medication, I managed to regain my health, comfort, and most importantly, my dignity back.

All this while my toenails went



I could finally get rid of the thick, brittle, crumbly and rotten nails.

I have no more ugly and painful skin rashes.

My nails got stronger, brighter and restored their healthy pinky color while I rid myself of the shame and humiliation of thick dark, infected toenails.

This sacred African ritual which has been thoroughly studied and its beneficial effects have been confirmed by over a dozen independent sources, such as the The Journal of European Academy Of Dermatology or National Center for Biotechnology Information.

See for yourself HERE.

In 1628, during the reign of Charles I, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord High Admiral of England, was assassinated and the office was placed in commission, under the control of a Board of Commissioners. The first such First Lord of the Admiralty was Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland, who was appointed in 1628. The First Lord was not always a permanent member of the board until the Admiralty Department was established as an official government department in 1709[3] with the First Lord as its head; it replaced the earlier Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs.[4] During most of the 17th century and the early 18th century, it was not invariable for the Admiralty to be in commission, so there are gaps in the list of First Lords, and a small number of First Lords were for a time Lord High Admiral. After the Revolution, in 1690, a declaratory Act was passed, during the reign of William and Mary. Parliament passed the Admiralty Act, vesting in the Commissioners the powers formerly held by the Lord High Admiral of England.[5] and at this point became a permanent Cabinet position. The Admiralty Commission was dissolved in 1701, but was reconstituted in 1709 on the death of Prince George of Denmark,[3] who had been appointed Lord High Admiral. The office has been held in commission from that time onwards, however, except for a short period (1827–28) when the Duke of Clarence was Lord High Admiral. The Board of the Admiralty comprised a number of "Lords Commissioners" headed by a First Lord.[5] From the early 1800s the post was always held by a civilian[6] (previously flag officers of the Royal Navy also held the post). In 1832 First Lord Sir James Graham instituted reforms and amalgamated the Board of Admiralty and the Navy Board. By the provisions of the Admiralty Act of 1832, two Lords in committee could legalise any action of the Bo
