Hi there!
Unfortunately, I need to start our conversation with bad news for you.
Around few months back I managed to get full access to all devices of =
yours,=20
which are used by you on a daily basis to browse internet.

Afterwards, I could initiate monitoring and tracking of all your =
activities on the internet.

I am proud to share the sequence of how it happened:=20
In the past I bought from hackers the access to various email accounts =
(today, that is rather a simple thing to do online).
Clearly, it was not hard at all for me to log in to your email account =
(bruce@untroubled.org).

A week after that, I had already managed to effortlessly install Trojan =
virus to Operating Systems of all devices that are currently in your =
use, and as result gained access to your email.
To be honest, that was not really difficult at all (because you were =
eagerly opening the links from your inbox emails).=20
I know, I am a genius. ^^=20

With help of that software, I can gain access to all controllers in your =
devices (such as video camera, keyboard and microphone).
As result, I downloaded to my remote cloud servers all your personal =
data, photos and other information including web browsing history.
Likewise, I have complete access to all your social networks, =
messengers, chat history, emails, as well as contacts list.
My intelligent virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (due to its =
driver-based nature), and hereby stays unnoticed by your antivirus =
software.

Herbey, I believe that now you finally start realizing how I could =
easily remain unnoticed all this while until this very letter...
While collecting information related to you, I had also unveiled that =
you are a true fan of porn sites.
You truly enjoy browsing through adult sites and watching horny vids, =
while playing your dirty solo games.

Bingo! I also recorded several filthy scenes with you in the main focus =
and montaged some dirty videos, which demonstrate your passionate =
masturbation and cum sessions.

In case you still don't believe me, all I need is just one-two mouse =
clicks to make all your unmasking videos become available to your =
friends, colleagues, and even relatives.
Well, if you still doubt me, I can easily make recorded videos of your =
orgasms become a public.
I truly believe that you surely would avoid that from happening,=20
taking in consideration the type of the XXX videos you love watching, =
(you are clearly aware of what I mean) it will result in a huge disaster =
for you.

Well, there is still a way to settle this tricky situation in a peaceful =
manner:
You will need to transfer $960 USD to my account (refer to Bitcoin =
equivalent based on the exchange rate at the moment transfer),=20
so once funds transfer is complete, I will straight away proceed with =
deleting all that dirty content from servers once and for all.

Afterwards, you can consider that we never met before. You have my =
honest word, that all the harmful software will also be deactivated and =
deleted from all your devices currently in use.=20
Worry not, I keep my promises.
That is truly a win-win solution that comes at a relatively reduced =
cost, mostly knowing how much effort I spent on monitoring your profile =
and traffic for a considerably long time.
In event that you have no idea about means of buying and transferring =
bitcoins &#8211; don't hesitate to use any search engine for your =
assistance (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.).

My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 1Lt2Ns6FEPTPHA6pENS1Rhym1KAt43FFUp

I have allocated 48 hours for you to do that, and the timer started =
right after you opened this very email (2 days to be exact).

Don't even think of doing anything of the following:
*Abstain from attempting to reply me (this email was created by me =
inside your inbox page and the return address was generated =
accordingly).
*Abstain from attempting to get in touch with police or any other =
security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing this to you =
friends.=20
 Once I discover this (apparently, that is absolutely easy for me, =
taking in consideration that I have complete control over all systems =
you use) - your kinky video will straight away be made public.=20
*Don't even think of attempting to find me &#8211; that is completely =
useless. Don't forget that all cryptocurrency transactions remain =
completely anonymous.
*Don't attempt reinstalling the OS on all your devices or getting rid of =
them. That won't lead you to success either, because I have already =
saved all videos at my remote servers as a backup.

Things you should not be concerned about:
*That your funds transfer won't reach my wallet.
- Worry not, I can see everything, hence after you finish the transfer, =
I will get a notification right away=20
 (trojan virus of mine uses a remote-control feature, which functions =
similarly to TeamViewer).
*That I will still distribute your videos although you make the funds =
transfer.
- My word, I have no intention or interest in continuing making your =
life troublesome.=20
 Anyway, If I truly wanted that, it would happen long time ago without =
me notifying you!=20

Everything can be settled in a peaceful and just way!
And lastly... make sure you don't get caught afterwards in such type of =
incidents anymore!
My fair advice &#8211; ensure you change all your passwords on a regular =
basis.
