<p> This natural but melancholy image is peculiar to Homer.   Osterman and Broderson would be there.   The emperor, who, amidst the ruins of the Roman world, revived the ancient language of law and liberty, which Trajan would not have disclaimed, must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart; since they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age, or the example of his predecessors.   I want to make this the best etext edition possible for both scholars and the general public.   Tune up, Buck.   Canis.
