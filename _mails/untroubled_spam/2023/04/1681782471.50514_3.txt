<p><span style="font-size:20px;">My friend Sharon just lost 34 pounds, SEVENTEEN of those in the first few weeks... right after she started this simple morning routine...</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:20px;">Prior to this, nothing worked for her... at best she&#39;d lose weight one week, just to gain it back the next.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-size:20px;">But when she started&nbsp;doing THIS every morning, things rapidly shifted...</span></p>

<p> For a few seconds he stood there, his back turned, seemingly absorbed in the display, but eyeing the street narrowly nevertheless; then he turned around, gave a last look about and stepped swiftly into the doorway by the great brass sign.  When the Romans barely heard all this, they commiserated their case; while the seditious, who saw it also, did not repent, but suffered the same distress to come upon themselves; for they were blinded by that fate which was already coming upon the city, and upon themselves also.   If I cannot have her, at least let me see her as she was, real, earthly, not her spirit, her ghost.   From the ruins of the Byzantine libraries, from the darkest monasteries of Germany and Britain, he collected the dusty manuscripts of the writers of antiquity; and wherever the original could not be removed, a faithful copy was transcribed and transmitted for his use.   The count arrived soon afterward, and I now&mdash;pardon me the neglect and ingratitude which my words confess&mdash;I now felt very happy.   In about an hour we were waked up by the hauling of the chain about decks, and in a few minutes All hands ahoy!

Hodie tamen viv exuruntur vel ad bestias dantur, Paul.  I tried to reason with him about it, but he had the best of all arguments, that from experience, at hand, and was not to be moved.   Eudocia composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the Old Testament, and of the prophecies of Daniel and Zechariah; a cento of the verses of Homer, applied to the life and miracles of Christ, the legend of St. Cyprian, and a panegyric on the Persian victories of Theodosius; and her writings, which were applauded by a servile and superstitious age, have not been disdained by the candor of impartial criticism.   They were often capricious and accidental; a dream, an omen, the report of a miracle, the example of some priest, or hero, the charms of a believing wife, and, above all, the fortunate event of a prayer, or vow, which, in a moment of danger, they had addressed to the God of the Christians.   ``The Boy s Froissart, being Sir John Froissart s Chronicles of Adventure, Battle, and Custom in England, France, Spain.   c. 1 - 4. </p>
