Today, they want to let you know that, unfortunately, if you don’t act in the next 6 hours… we cannot guarantee this complimentary Dashcam will still be available to you.

Although there were 500 of these set aside to hand out Free...

Demand has been far greater than anticipated -- and they’re close to being gone.

That’s why you must claim your Free Dashcam now if you want one.

These little automatic Dashcams have a ton of uses:

Stop fraudulent claims against your insurance

Prove you weren’t at fault in vehicular accidents

Protect yourself from Police Misconduct

They also shoot in full 1080p HD, and have a crystal clear night-vision mode as well.

But like I said…

There aren’t many of these Free Dashcams left.

And once this giveaway closes, you’ll likely have to pay full price ($69) to get one.

So don’t dilly dally…

Grab yours now while they’re still available Free.

P.S. -- Many car insurance companies are offering deep discounts to drivers who use these Dashcams.

So if yours is one of them, you’ll practically make money by grabbing one of these Free while.















The federal government created the United States Railway Association (USRA) in 1974 to manage the formation of Conrail, which was to take over a number of bankrupt railroads in the Northeast, including Penn Central. Penn Central owned a 71-mile (114 km) line that connected Worcester to Groton, Connecticut, via Plainfield, Connecticut. The USRA decided to include only the portion between Groton and Plainfield in Conrail, with the remaining portion reverting to its original owner: the Norwich and Worcester Railroad (N&W). The N&W had been leased by a variety of railroads since 1869, but was now independent again, and proposed to resume operating its portion of the line.[56] Seeing an opportunity for expansion, the Providence and Worcester made a bid for the line from Plainfield to Worcester as well, winning the support of Connecticut business groups, unions, and Chris Dodd, at the time a U.S. Representative.[57] The latter stated in January 1974 that it was "extremely questionable whether the Norwich and Worcester has demonstrated the ability to provide even minimal service to eastern Connecticut".[58] The USRA found the arguments of the Providence and Worcester and its supporters that it was in a better position to take over the line on account of its years of profitable operations persuasive, and transferred it to the railroad later that year.[59] The remaining 27 miles (43 km) of the N&W went to Conrail, but the Providence and Worcester was not satisfied with its share of the line and sought to acquire the rest of the line from the newly formed railroad. Conrail initially was unprofitable, and in 1976 the Providence and Worcester approached the company with an offer to buy its 27-mile line between Plainfield and Groton. Conrail was unwilling to give up the line, which was one of its most profitable in the state, leading the Connecticut Department of Transportation to request that the federal government order the line transferred that year.[60][61][62] The following year, Conrail was forced to sell the line, due to the law that established the company requiring it to sell lines to any private companies offering a fair price.[62] Despite this, Conrail continued to operate the line while debate continued between the two railroads over what constituted a "fair price" – Conrail wanted over $3 million, while the Providence and Worcester offered und
