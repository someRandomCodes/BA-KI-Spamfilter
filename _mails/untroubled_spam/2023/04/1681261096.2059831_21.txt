<p> ``The Promised Land, by Mary Antin.   Marriage was allowed as a necessa=
ry means for the propagation of mankind; after the death of either party, t=
he survivor might satisfy, by a second union, the weakness or the strength =
of the flesh: but a third marriage was censured as a state of legal fornica=
tion; and a fourth was a sin or scandal as yet unknown to the Christians of=
 the East.   Yet, according to the Twelve Tables, a prescription of one yea=
r for movables, and of two years for immovables, abolished the claim of the=
 ancient master, if the actual possessor had acquired them by a fair transa=
ction from the person whom he believed to be the lawful proprietor.   Besid=
es this, Delaney had now placed his horse between Magnus and the ditch, and=
 two others riding up from the rear had followed his example.   half supers=
titious, that the province which had been ruined by the bigotry of Justinia=
n, was the same through which the Mahometans penetrated into the empire.  A=
s we left the gale behind us, the reefs were shaken out of the topsails, an=
d sail made as fast as she could bear it; and every time all hands were sen=
t to the halyards, a song was called for, and we hoisted away with a will. =
  His oath in the Capitol proclaims his right and duty to observe and asser=
t the laws, to control the proud, to protect the poor, and to exercise just=
ice and mercy within the extent of his jurisdiction.   His splendid achieve=
ments, the bashaws whom he encountered, the armies that he discomfited, and=
 the three thousand Turks who were slain by his single hand, must be weighe=
d in the scales of suspicious criticism.  Fernand is, moreover, well acquai=
nted with the language by which the deaf and dumb communicate their ideas; =
and through friendship for me he will break the tidings of my marriage to m=
y sister.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it as you propose,&rdquo; said the grand vizier;=
 then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, he added, speaking in a low and myster=
ious whisper: &ldquo;and if you will not shrink from the contact of the ren=
egade at the altar of God&mdash;a renegade in name only, and not in heart&m=
dash;a renegade to suit his worldly purposes, and not from conviction&mdash=
;then shall I be present at the ceremony.   Instead of some rude villages, =
thinly scattered among its woods and morasses, Germany now produces a list =
of two thousand three hundred walled towns: the Christian kingdoms of Denma=
rk, Sweden, and Poland, have been successively established; and the Hanse m=
erchants, with the Teutonic knights, have extended their colonies along the=
 coast of the Baltic, as far as the Gulf of Finland. </p>=0D
