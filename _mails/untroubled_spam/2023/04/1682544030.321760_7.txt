Attention:


My name is Mr. Mark Obinna a Computer Scientist Central Bank of
Nigeria. I am 30 years old, I just started work with C.B.N. and I came
across your payment file which was marked X and your released disk
painted RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have paid
VIRTUALLY all fees and certificate to receive your payment but the
fund has not been release to you. The most annoying thing is that they
cannot tell you the truths that on no account will they ever release
this fund to you; instead they let you spend money unnecessarily.


I do not intend to work in this ministry all the days of my life as I
can release the fund to you if you certify me of my security, and how
I can run away from this Nigeria if I do this, because if after doing
this and did not run away from this country, I will be seriously in
trouble and my life will be in danger. Please this is like a Mafia
setting in Nigeria; you may not understand it because you are not a
Nigerian.


The only thing I will need to release this fund is a special HARD DISK
which we call (250 GIG MONEY MATERIAL). I will buy two of it, recopy
your information, destroy the previous one, and punch the computer to
enable fund reflect into your bank account within 24 banking hours.
Upon confirmation of the HARD DISK I will clean up tracer and destroy
your file, after which I will run away from Nigeria to meet with you.
If you have read and satisfy with my information, do get back to me
immediately with your full details,


Endeavor to send your private telephone number for easy communications.



Mr Mark Obinna
