Cambridge won the coin toss and the Light Blue boat club president, Tim Wooge, was clear: "Cambridge choose Surrey".[30] Cambridge elected to start from the southern bank (the "Surrey side") of the Thames, handing the northern side of the river (the "Middlesex side") to Oxford.[31] At race time, conditions were overcast and breezy.[32] Oxford took an early lead with a slightly higher stroke rate than Cambridge as both coxes were warned by the umpire to avoid a clash. By the Mile Post, the Dark Blues were half-a-second ahead.[33] Five minutes into the race, Oxford, with a third of a length lead, were warned again by the umpire and moved away from the racing line, and following a series of oar clashes, allowed Cambridge to take the lead, shooting Hammersmith Bridge a second ahead.[33] Oxford continued to stay in touch with Cambridge along the long middle bend of the course, towards the Chiswick Steps, and retook the lead on the approach to Barnes Bridge as the course curved back in their favour.[33] With a three-quarter length lead at Barnes, Oxford began to weaken and Cambridge recovered to a third of a length. With every stroke, the Cambridge boat gained on Oxford, outrating them in a "sprint finish",[33] but the Dark Blues passed the finishing post 1 foot (30 cm) ahead, the narrowest winning margin in the history of the race.[32][34] Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes 6 seconds.[31] Rankov did not initially announce the result, instead he "spread his arms wide and shrugged his shoulders".[35] The result was confirmed to Rankov by finishing judge Ben Kent, with the winning margin being approximately 0.05 seconds,[36] and announced to the crews by Rankov under Chiswick Bridge: "One foot to Oxford".[37] James Livingston wrote of himself at the finish: "eyes widen and bulge in horror. Our desolation is total."[38] It was the first time a crew had won the ra
