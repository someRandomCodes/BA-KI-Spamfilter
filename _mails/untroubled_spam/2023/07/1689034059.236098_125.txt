Is 1 Mistranslated Word In The Bible Killing You?

Compton's absent-mindedness was legendary. Colin Cowdrey writes that Compton turned up for the Old Trafford Test of 1955 against South Africa without his kitbag. Undaunted, he sauntered into the museum and, borrowing an antique bat off the display, went on to score 158 and 71. Nevertheless, England lost by three wickets. This absent-mindedness was particularly obvious in his tendency to run out his partners at the crease: Trevor Bailey declared that "a call for a run from Compton should be treated as no more than a basis for negotiation". In typical form, at his brother Leslie's benefit match in 1955, he managed to run Leslie out before he had faced a single ball.


Compton's career performance graph
Peter Parfitt, the Middlesex and England batsman, was a speaker at a major celebration in London for Compton's 70th birthday. He claims that the chief guest was called to the telephone by a lady who had heard about the dinner. Eventually, he agreed to take the call. "Denis," she said, "it's me, your mother. You're not 70, you're only 69."

After retiring from sport, Denis Compton became a journalist and later a commentator for BBC Television. He was made a CBE in 1958. He became the first former professional cricketer to be elected President of Middlesex County Cricket Club in 1991. He served two terms, until a week before his death from septicaemia in Windsor, Berkshire aged 78.

Compton's death, on Saint George's Day, coincided with the opening of the 1997 County Championship season, and pavilion flags across the country were lowered to half-mast in his memory. The MCC named the twin stands at the Nursery End of Lord's Cricket Ground in his and Bill Edrich's honour. Cricket writer Colin Bateman noted, however, that it was "a dull, practical structure which does little justice to their mercurial talents and indomitable spirits".

Compton was also honoured at the Shenley Cricket Centre, where the main pitch is named the Denis Compton Oval. That is where his grandson, Nick Compton, set the Middlesex record for the 6th wicket partnership in List A cricket

<div style="max-width:100%;height:auto;width:500px;">
<div style="width:500px;text-align:left;padding:10px;font-family:sans-serif;">Hi,
<p>According to Pastor Andrew, the answer is YES.</p>

<p>And in his short video, he provides very strong evidence to support this controversial (but rapidly growing) theory.</p>

<p>At first, we were quite skeptical, and I even asked the pastor point blank...</p>

<p><a href="http://handmsurvey.shop/i-hJIqGX54-9ttRU_hgJzBhFXQncfcxXOa0VBGzCQ_TLl7fpBA" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank">&ldquo;Are you saying that God made a mistake?&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>The pastor was quick to respond, and said &ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes. But 1800 years ago, we believe a biblical translator DID.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pastor then went on to explain his theory...</p>

<p><a href="http://handmsurvey.shop/i-hJIqGX54-9ttRU_hgJzBhFXQncfcxXOa0VBGzCQ_TLl7fpBA" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank">&ldquo;It is our belief that ONE, single, mistranslated word in the bible &ndash; which occurred about 200 years after the death of Jesus &ndash;is responsible for an incredible amount of needless suffering.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>I felt that the pastor <em>truly</em> believed what he was claiming...</p>

<p>So I decided to watch his video.</p>

<p>And frankly, it was as shocking to me as it was eye-opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our belief that ONE, single, mistranslated word in the bible &ndash; which occurred about 200 years after the death of Jesus &ndash;is responsible for an incredible amount of needless suffering.&rdquo;I felt that the pastor truly believed what he was claiming...So I decided to watch his video.And frankly, it was as shocking to me as it was eye-opening.But you be the judge for yourself.</p>

<p>To your health,</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> According to the pastor (and maybe he&rsquo;s just being paranoid but...) certain left-leaning departments of our government are actively trying toSuppress.</p>

<p>Watch the secret he exposes in his controversial video</p>
