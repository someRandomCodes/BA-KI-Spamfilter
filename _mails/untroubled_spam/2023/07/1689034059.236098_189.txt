The committed dose in radiological protection is a measure of the stochastic health risk due to an intake of radioactive material into the human body. Stochastic in this context is defined as the probability of cancer induction and genetic damage, due to low levels of radiation. The SI unit of measure is the sievert.

A committed dose from an internal source represents the same effective risk as the same amount of effective dose applied uniformly to the whole body from an external source, or the same amount of equivalent dose applied to part of the body. The committed dose is not intended as a measure for deterministic effects, such as radiation sickness, which are defined as the severity of a health effect which is certain to happen.

The radiation risk proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) predicts that an effective dose of one sievert carries a 5.5% chance of developing cancer. Such a risk is the sum of both internal and external radiation dose.

ICRP definition
The ICRP states "Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate the tissues over time periods determined by their physical half-life and their biological retention within the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues for many months or years after the intake. The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and the accumulation of radiation dose over extended periods of time has led to the definition of committed dose quantities".

The ICRP defines two dose quantities for individual committed dose.

Committed equivalent dose is the time integral of the equivalent dose rate in a particular tissue or organ that will be received by an individual following intake of radioactive material into the body by a Reference Person, where t is the integration time in years. This refers specifically to the dose in a specific tissue or organ, in the similar way to external equivalent dose.
Committed effective dose, is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors WT, where t is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children. This refers specifically to the dose to the whole body, in the similar way to external effective dose. The committed effective dose is used to demonstrate compliance with dose limits and is entered into the "dose of record" for occupational exposures used for recording, reporting and retrospective demonstration of compliance with regulatory dose limits.
The ICRP further states "For internal exposure, committed effective doses

<p>Dear,</p>

<p>Did you know there is a mineral that converts food to hair cells?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sonoblisz.shop/b31pN_y8Uxi9ay4H1LOaJcs6unpzvG-C5AY1Fn9AaLgvO1A">Your hair loves it</a>.</strong></p>

<p>CNN covered it over here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://sonoblisz.shop/b31pN_y8Uxi9ay4H1LOaJcs6unpzvG-C5AY1Fn9AaLgvO1A"><img alt="" src="http://sonoblisz.shop/c9b35dc9049472e530.png" /></a></p>

<p>Even the hair you can&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re experiencing thinning hair, receding hair line, or are balding in certain parts of your head there are a few things you need to know.</p>

<p>The <strong>&ldquo;hair bulb&rdquo;</strong> (which is the part of your hair underneath the surface of your scalp) feeds of certain nutrients.</p>

<p>There are 4 of them that boost hair growth and thickness more than any other.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sonoblisz.shop/b31pN_y8Uxi9ay4H1LOaJcs6unpzvG-C5AY1Fn9AaLgvO1A">&gt;&gt;&gt;Click here to find out what they are RIGHT HERE!&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></strong></p>

<p>But they&rsquo;ll only work if you have eliminated any and all <em>&ldquo;hair loss triggers&rdquo;</em> that you may have.</p>

<p><strong>So it&rsquo;s a 2-step process.</strong></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t feed your hair back to life AND you don&rsquo;t eliminate your hair loss triggers, don&rsquo;t waste your time with anything else.</p>
