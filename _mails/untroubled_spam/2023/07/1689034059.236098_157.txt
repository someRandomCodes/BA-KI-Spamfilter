nager of the AEC on 2 November 1953.

The AEC was in charge of developing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, taking over these responsibilities from the wartime Manhattan Project. In its first decade, the AEC oversaw the operation of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, devoted primarily to weapons development, and in 1952, the creation of new second weapons laboratory in California, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The AEC also carried out the "crash program" to develop the hydrogen bomb (H-bomb), and the AEC played a key role in the prosecution of the Rosenbergs for espionage.

The AEC also began a program of regular nuclear weapons testing, both in the faraway Pacific Proving Grounds and at the Nevada Test Site in the western United States. While the AEC also supported much basic research, the vast majority of its early budget was devoted to nuclear weapons development and production.[citation needed]

With Oppenheimer and Lilienthal removed, President Truman announced his decision to develop and produce the hydrogen bomb. The first test firing of an experimental H-bomb ("Ivy Mike") was carried out in the Central Pacific on November 1, 1952, under President Truman. Furthermore, U.S. Navy Admiral Lewis. W. Strauss was appointed in 1953 by the new President Eisenhower as the Chairman of the AEC, to carry out the military development and production of the H-bomb.

Lilienthal wanted to give high priority to peaceful uses, especially with nuclear power plants. However, coal was still cheap, and the electric power industry was not interested. The first experimental nuclear power plant was started in Pennsylvania under President Eisenhower in 1954.

<br />
If you want to drop 15, 25, even 50lbs or more, you could:<br />
<br />
1) Fill your plate with tons of veggies and dry chicken breast at every single meal<br />
<br />
Or:<br />
<br />

<br />
Which forces your body to double or even triple the amount of calories you burn throughout the day.<br />
<br />
Even if you don&rsquo;t exercise. The science behind this is still pretty new and I don&rsquo;t want to bore you with it, just know.<br />
<br />
If you want a flatter belly starting tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Give this a shot:<br />
