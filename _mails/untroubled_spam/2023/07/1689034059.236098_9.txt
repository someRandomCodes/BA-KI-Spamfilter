Classically, ARS is divided into three main presentations: hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and neuro vascular. These syndromes may be preceded by a prodrome. The speed of symptom onset is related to radiation exposure, with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset. These presentations presume whole-body exposure, and many of them are markers that are invalid if the entire body has not been exposed. Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed (e.g., gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation). Some areas affected are:

Hematopoietic. This syndrome is marked by a drop in the number of blood cells, called aplastic anemia. This may result in infections, due to a low number of white blood cells, bleeding, due to a lack of platelets, and anemia, due to too few red blood cells in circulation. These changes can be detected by blood tests after receiving a whole-body acute dose as low as 0.25 grays (25 rad), though they might never be felt by the patient if the dose is below 1 gray (100 rad). Conventional trauma and burns resulting from a bomb blast are complicated by the poor wound healing caused by hematopoietic syndrome, increasing mortality.
Gastrointestinal. This syndrome often follows absorbed doses of 6–30 grays (600–3,000 rad). The signs and symptoms of this form of radiation injury include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above 4 grays (400 rad). Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common, due generally more to infection than gastrointestinal dysfunction.
Neurovascular. This syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than 30 grays (3,000 rad), though it may occur at doses as low as 10 grays (1,000 rad). It presents with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, headache, or decreased level of consciousness, occurring within minutes to

If you answered <strong>&ldquo;YES&rdquo;</strong>, then this will be the answer to it all..<br />
<br />
Listen, there&rsquo;s been a 20 word script used by Nikola Tesla, and even Bob Proctor..<br />
<br />
That they have used to manifest 100X faster, and force the universe to give what they want<br />
<br />
And it&rsquo;s been leaked for the first time <a href="http://walgreensurvey.shop/S8odWOZolb9r-eHaWhspWdqrshNsUtg9ZwKqgJ9irAvQVl9t-g" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank">(click here to see it)..</a><br />
