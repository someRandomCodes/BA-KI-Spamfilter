Greetings:

I am sorry to invade your privacy in this way, I only pray at this time that your email address is still valid. I am contacting you because my status would not allow me to do this alone. I would like to ask you to receive money on my behalf. Can I trust you to do business? I will send you full details and more information about myself and the when I receive your reply.

Please reply so that we can have a better discussion.

Best wishes.
