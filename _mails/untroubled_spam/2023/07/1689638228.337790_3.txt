For Operation Totalize, the Canadians converted the surplus Priests into armoured personnel carriers, known as Kangaroos, by removing the guns and welding over the front apertures. The conversion was carried out by Canadian and REME workshops.

In the Overlord planning, the 14-man ration pack that had proved satisfactory in the North African Campaign was adopted for use after the initial assault until bulk rations could be issued. The problem was how to feed the troops in the first 48 hours, as the assault packs used in Madagascar and Operation Torch had been found to be too heavy and bulky proportional to their nutritional value. A new 24-hour ration pack was therefore devised for Overlord. Two proposed ration packs were tested under field conditions in June 1943 and a new 24-hour ration was produced that combined the merits of both. The resulting 24-hour ration pack was a 17-kilojoule (4,000 cal) ration that weighed 990 grams (35 oz) and at 1,500 cubic centimetres (90 cu in) could fit into the standard British Army mess tin. The War Office then ordered 7.5 million of them, with a delivery date of 31 March 1944. Only by strenuous efforts was this achieved.

The field service (FS) bulk ration was in general use by 21 July, although combat units continued using the ration packs for certain operations. The FS ration was entirely composed of preserved components but it was supplemented by shipments of fresh meat, fruit and vegetables. Hospital patients began to receive fresh bread on 13 June, and it was in general issue by 5 August. The mixture of tea, sugar and powdered milk in the ration packs was widely disliked and advantage was taken of an order authorising the issue of tea, sugar and milk to troops engaged in "heavy and arduous" night work. As a result, a large proportion of the 21st Army Group became engaged in such activities, unbalancing the reserve r

<br />
However, according to Dr. Saunders, Neurological expert &mdash; having high blood sugar can affect the nerves in your digestive system - particularly, your anal sphincter. (the muscle that contracts or relaxes for bowel movements.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://keragenis.rest/Nm3J-x9mB1pkcgDljGcH_0U-NTWPLG_MP9XXL3frPWwuRZvO2w"><img src="http://keragenis.rest/de49877f7673318257.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 500px;height:auto;w" /></a><br />
<br />
And when those rectum nerves become damaged, it can lead to fecal incontinence. <i>*Which is the inability to control bowel movements. Causing feces to leak unexpectedly from the rectum.*</i><br />
<br />
And even if you are not experiencing any leaking (YET), another sign is that you constantly &quot;FEEL LIKE&quot; you need to use the restroom (#2) - but nothing comes out.<br />
<br />
Again, this is because the nerves that control that feeling of needing to go - have been affected.<br />
<br />
Many people will end up pushing and causing even more blood vessel damage there, along with painful hemorrhoids and bleeding.<br />
<br />
And on the opposite end, your body may need to actually let out fecal matter, BUT the nerve damage in the sphincter may not get the signal - causing constipation. (forcing fecal matter to be trapped in the body and making it a perfect breeding ground for bacterial infections.)<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a terrible and an embarrassing thing to have to go through. (on top of the burning and itching)<br />
<br />
The good news is, this problem can be <strong>easily fixed in the privacy of your own home.</strong><br />
<br />
And it has nothing to do with using enemas, seeing a doctor or any invasive treatments.<br />
<br />
Dr. Saunders has released a brand new &quot;2 step method&quot; video to the public.<br />

It&#39;s free and will be up for the next 24 hours. (As it&#39;s normally exclusive to his patients.)<br />
<br />
And not only does this video show how you can help the body process sugar more effectively, help with digestive issues (caused by diabetes) and retake control of those nerve issues that high blood sugar can lead to.<br />
<br />
<i><strong>It also helps fight &quot;leaky gut&quot; -</strong></i> this is where the gut lining is damaged and cannot optimally function as a barrier any longer. Causing digestive juices and bowel remains to leak into the body&hellip;<br />
<br />
Causing diarrhea, constipation, bloating and even skin problems, such as acne, rashes, or eczema.<br />
<br />
Remember, Leaky Gut and Leaky Stool are all linked&hellip;<br />

Listen, this video has gone viral for helping people with diabetes and nerve issues get back to normal and do away with many embarrassing problems.<br />
