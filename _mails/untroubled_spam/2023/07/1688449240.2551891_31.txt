he BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of Broadcasting House, London, on 22 August 1932. The channel officially began regular broadcasts on 2 November 1936 from a converted wing of the Alexandra Palace in London.

On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared war on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning, with the last programme to be shown being a Mickey Mouse cartoon (the 1933 short Mickey's Gala Premier); the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft that could bomb London.

BBC Television returned on 7 June 1946 at three o'clock in the afternoon. Jasmine Bligh, one of the original announcers, made the first announcement, saying, "Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?". Twenty minutes later, BBC Television again aired the Mickey Mouse cartoon that they had broadcast in 1939.

Creation of BBC1
The BBC held a statutory monopoly on television broadcasting in the United Kingdom until Associated-Rediffusion, the first Independent Television (ITV) station, began to broadcast on 22 September 1955. The competition quickly forced the channel to change its identity and priorities, following a large reduction in its audience, as noted in the 1962 Pilkington Report on the future of broadcasting. Simultaneously, the Pilkington Report decided to award

<mark>Most guys don&#39;t want to talk about it&hellip;</mark><br />
<br />
But men with diabetes are 3X more likely to <a href="http://maasaalong.today/Wri5dKxaukcCC63Irn4hgh1yKfbC9aU1DOq1ofqzwKAy5SSQ8Q" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="color:#ff0000; font-weight:bold;" target="blank">get erectile dysfunction...</a><br />
<br />
So let&#39;s not pretend like all is well in the bedroom when the truth is... diabetes is waging war on your manhood right now.<br />
<br />
The tricky part is...<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t treat diabetes-induced ED like you would &quot;normal&quot; ED.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal&quot; erectile dysfunction can be helped with certain diet changes, drugs, or in some cases maybe pumps or rings&hellip;<br />
<br />
But diabetes-induced ED is a nightmare of its own that requires a totally unique and different approach...<br />

<br />
And it&#39;s something that ANY man can use from the comfort of his own home to get the rock-hard firmness and reliability that&#39;s been missing for years.<br />
<br />
See how thousands of other men are restoring that high-school backseat love-making passion into their marriage in a matter of days using a strange Biblical ingredient that you may have in your house right now&hellip;<br />
