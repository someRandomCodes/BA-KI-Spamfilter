ccidental exposure may be the result of a criticality or radiotherapy accident. There have been numerous criticality accidents dating back to atomic testing during World War II, while computer-controlled radiation therapy machines such as Therac-25 played a major part in radiotherapy accidents. The latter of the two is caused by the failure of equipment software used to monitor the radiational dose given. Human error has played a large part in accidental exposure incidents, including some of the criticality accidents, and larger scale events such as the Chernobyl disaster. Other events have to do with orphan sources, in which radioactive material is unknowingly kept, sold, or stolen. The Goiânia accident is an example, where a forgotten radioactive source was taken from a hospital, resulting in the deaths of 4 people from ARS. Theft and attempted theft of radioactive material by clueless thieves has also led to lethal exposure in at least one incident.

Exposure may also come from routine spaceflight and solar flares that result in radiation effects on earth in the form of solar storms. During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to both galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and solar particle event (SPE) radiation. The exposure particularly occurs during flights beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts. GCR levels that might lead to acute radiation poisoning are less well understood. The latter cause is rarer, with an event possibly occurring during the solar storm of 1859.

Intentional exposure is controversial as it involves the use of nuclear weapons, human experiments, or is given to a victim in an act of murder. The intentional atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in tens of thousands of casualties; the survivors of these bombings are known today as Hibakusha. Nuclear weapons emit large amounts of thermal radiation as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, to which the atmosphere is largely transparent. This event is also known as "Flash", where radiant heat and light are bombarded into any given victim's exposed skin, causing radiation burns. Death is highly likely, and radiation poisoning is almost certain if one is caught in the open with no terrain or building masking-effects within a radius of 0–3 km from a 1 megaton airburst. The 50% chance of death from the blast extends out to ~8 km from a 1 megaton atmospheri

Have you ever wondered why the Ancient Romans in 79 AD had <em>10x stronger teeth despite their age or lifestyle?</em><br />
<br />
A recent discovery of a Pompeii graveyard has left dental specialists speechless&hellip; All the skulls remains had perfect, brilliantly white teeth, with no cavities or decay in sight!<br />
<br />
<a href="http://bagelkingsnewyork.shop/l08iijqarqc55wePT9-BLLPWWgXCNQ7neBDqP2QE09U0wLq2eQ" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" style="font-weight:bold;" target="blank"><img src="http://bagelkingsnewyork.shop/9a4e11effa7fe4370b.png" /></a><br />
<br />
Researching this mystery has led scientists to discover a forgotten mineral that gives <strong>&quot;Perfect Teeth&quot;</strong><br />
<br />
<b>This allowed them to stay away from cavities, tooth decay and rotting, gingivitis, periodontitis, and gum inflammation. </b><br />
