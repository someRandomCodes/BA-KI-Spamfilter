The responsibilities of the Controller-General were the most extensive of all the administrative positions of the Ancien Régime. According to the official description of 1665, the Controller-General had the power "to report in our Counsel of all affairs which are of concern to our service and of any others" ("faire rapport en notre Conseil de toutes les affaires qui concerneront notre service et de toutes autres indifféremment").

Colbert, first of the Controllers-General with subsequent power, was also head of two other senior government posts equivalent to present-day ministers (from a total of six): Secretary of State of the Navy and Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi (Royal Household), both from 1669 till his death in 1683. In addition to those cabinet posts, he had also several important posts as administration chief, such as Surintendant des Manufactures et Bâtiments du Roi (Superintendent of the King's Manufacturers and Buildings; 1664–1683).

The Controller-General's responsibilities were manifold:

the control of State expenditures
the control of State revenues (taxes and fees)
the control of external and internal customs (traites)
the management of the national economy
the control of manufacturers and merchants
the management of most of the civil services and public infrastructure, including bridges and roads (ponts et chaussées), ports and canals
the control of the merchant navy
The position was very well paid: in addition to 200 000 livres tournois (French pounds) by year (the average income of a worker was about 250 to 300 livres per year), the Controller-General could also gain 20 000 livres as Minister of State, not to forget the bribes he would receive during the renewal phase of contracts to the Ferme Générale ("General Lease", meaning the selling to private companies or individuals of the time-limited right to collect all the indirect taxes plus bonus fees in a defined portion of the country, an extremely lucrative business for the leaseholders).

The Controller-General participated in a nu

Is it really possible to grow a bubble butt without building thick, beefy legs?<br />
<br />
Thanks to a recent leak of confidential Olympian training protocols, the answer is YES&hellip;<br />
<br />
Even if you haven&rsquo;t worked out a single day in your entire life.<br />
<br />

According to the leak, Olympic athletes are getting a natural &ldquo;butt lift&rdquo; using this<a href="http://younabiscbdgummies.shop/t9dtrHtMNKLBXe2a2k7uF1gfbH5TFcIPlkwkHFkLRrQeOJ1POA" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank"><b> 1 brand new, yet shockingly simple exercise.</b></a><br />
<br />
It was designed to build strong glutes and unlock the explosiveness of a cheetah&hellip;<br />
<br />
But it soon became their insider secret to building a gasp-worthy backside&hellip;<br />
<br />
Because it targets the glutes without targeting the thighs.<br />

<br />
I know it sounds crazy, but anyone can do it from home, no matter your age or athletic level.<br />
<br />
45-year-old mother of 3, Mary T., easily did this exercise twice per week in her living room to erase her back pain and add 3 inches to her glutes.<br />
