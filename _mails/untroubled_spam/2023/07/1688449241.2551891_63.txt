Shah's acting career began with work in inter-collegiate plays in Gujarati during the early 1990s. Her work included roles in several stage dramas including Ant Vagarni Antakshari and Doctor Tame Pan?. A 1995 piece by Rasa magazine reported that Shah had proved her abilities to become one of the stars of Gujarati theatre. In one of the plays, she was brought to the attention of a team member of the TV serial Campus (1993) who suggested that she audition for a part in it. She was accepted following a screen test. This was followed by several other serials, including the popular Zee TV shows Tara and Banegi Apni Baat (both 1993–1997), as well as Naya Nukkad (1993–1994) on Doordarshan and Daraar (1994–1995) on Zee TV.

The year 1995 marked Shah's first film appearance with a brief role in Ram Gopal Varma's Rangeela. A few days into shooting, she realised the part was different from what she was set up for, and she walked out of the sets as she felt cheated. Shah was reluctant to work in motion pictures after that, and the roles she was offered were mostly small character parts. She continued working in TV series, including Balaji Telefilms' Mano Ya Na Mano (1995–1999) and Doordarshan's Aarohan (1996–1997) and Sea Hawks (1997–1998). An anthology horror series, Mano Ya Na Mano starred Shah opposite Durga Jasraj in an episode titled "Kabzaa", directed by Homi Wadia, which was developed into a full-fledged serial called Kavach in 2016. Arohan, starring and produced by Pallavi Joshi, tells the story of a woman who joins the Indian Navy.

Breakthrough with Hasratein and Satya (1997–1999)
In 1997, Shah replaced Seema Kapoor in the TV series Hasratein (1996–1999) after over 120 episodes. In her first lead role, Shah starred as Savi, a married woman involved in an extramarital affair with a married man. Based on the Marathi novel Adhantari by Jaywant Dalvi, the show was popular with audiences and attracted attention for its commentary on the institution of marriage. India Today describes it as "one of the prime productions that changed the face of Indian television". The character
