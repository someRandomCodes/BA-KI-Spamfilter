Early French colony
In 1699 the French formed the first permanent European settlement in Louisi=
ana (New France), at Fort Maurepas. They were under the direction of Pierre=
 Le Moyne d'Iberville.[citation needed]

The first capital of New France from 1702 until 1711 was La Mobile, after w=
hich the capital was relocated to the site of present-day Mobile, Alabama.=
[citation needed]

In 1718, there were only 700 Europeans in Louisiana. B=C3=A9nard de la Harp=
e and his party left New Orleans in 1719 to explore the Red River. In 1721,=
 he explored the Arkansas River. At the Yazoo settlements in Mississippi he=
 was joined by Jean Benjamin who became the scientist for the expedition.=
[citation needed]

The Mississippi Company arranged ships to bring in 800 more settlers, who l=
anded in Louisiana in 1718, doubling the European population. Law encourage=
d some German-speaking people, including Alsatians and Swiss, to emigrate. =
They gave their names to the German Coast and the Lac des Allemands in Loui=
siana.[citation needed]

Prisoners were set free in Paris from September 1719 onwards, and encourage=
d by Law to marry young women recruited in hospitals.=
=
 In May 1720, after complaints from the Mississippi Company and the concess=
ioners about this class of French immigrants, the French government prohibi=
ted such deportations. However, there was a third shipment of prisoners
