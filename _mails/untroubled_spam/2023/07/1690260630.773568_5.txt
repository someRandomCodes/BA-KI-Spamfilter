Hello bruce@untroubled.org,

I am largely aware of the very high and alarming rate of fraud=20
going on around the whole world and a message like this will=20
definitely bring up thoughts into the mind of anybody about the=20
veracity of the information below and knowing that I just located=20
you and we haven't really met each other before now.

I am very sorry for intruding. I am contacting you because you=20
share the same last name with a deceased client of mine who died=20
a few years ago. He left behind huge bank deposits with no will=20
or testament. The bank has requested that I present any of his=20
relatives to claim his money otherwise it will be declared as=20
unclaimed and confiscated.

It is my plan therefore to present you to the bank as a relative=20
of my late client so that his deposit can be transferred to you=20
legally by virtue of the fact that you share the same last name=20
with him. I am able to make this presentation possible and will=20
guide you all the way until his funds are released to you. We=20
shall be sharing the proceeds of this claim equally if you accept=20
to work with me. I will share more details with you upon your=20
positive response to my email. I hope to hear from you soon.

Best Wishes,
=20
Bar.Peter Mantle
