<!-- with a nursing child in her arms. She was destined a couple of --><!-- years later to be the foster-mother of Henriette's little girl --><!-- and to play an important part in her life. But the pair had no --><!-- idea of that at present. They simply saw a proud and happy --><!-- mother, and Henriette played with the baby, giving vent to --><!-- childish delight. Then suddenly she looked up and saw that --><!-- George was watching her, and as she read his thoughts a beautiful --><!-- blush suffused her cheeks. --><!-- As for George, he turned away and went out under the blue sky in --><!-- a kind of ecstasy. Life seemed very wonderful to him just then; --><!-- he had found its supreme happiness, which was love. He was --><!-- really getting quite mad about Henriette, he told himself. He --><!-- could hardly believe that the day was coming when he would be --><!-- able to clasp her in his arms. --><!-- But in the blue sky of George's happiness there was one little --><!-- cloud of storm. As often happens with storm-clouds, it was so --><!-- small that at first he paid no attention to it at all. --><!-- He noted upon his body one day a tiny ulcer. At first he treated --><!-- it with salve purchased from an apothecary. Then after a week or --><!-- two, when this had no effect, he began to feel uncomfortable. He --><!-- remembered suddenly he had heard about the symptoms of an --><!-- unmentionable, dreadful disease, and a vague terror took --><!-- possession of him. --><!-- For days he tried to put it to one side. The idea was nonsense, --><!-- it was absurd in connection with a woman so respectable! But the --><!-- thought would not be put away, and finally he went to a school --><!-- friend, who was a man of the world, and got him to talk on the --><!-- subject. Of course, George had to be careful, so that his friend --><!-- should not suspect that he had any special purpose in mind. -->

He realized that the sensible thing would be for him to go --><!-- to a doctor and make certain about his condition; but he could --><!-- not bring himself to face the ordeal--he was ashamed to admit to --><!-- a doctor that he had laid himself open to such a taint. --><!-- He began to lose the radiant expression from his round and rosy --><!-- face.
