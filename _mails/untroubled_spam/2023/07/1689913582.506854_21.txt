<p style="margin-left: 10px;">It may be the most harmless activity known to man, but it's also one of the<br />
biggest dangers to your health.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>IT'S SITTING!</strong><br />
<br />
Even if you're the most active of athletes, you may still suffer from tight hip<br />
flexors due to the amount of time you spend each day planted to a chair.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">If you have tight hip flexors from sitting too much you may be kicking<br />
your body into fat storing mode and it has nothing to do with inactivity.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://www.livhealthy.co/3~MGs-k_6127b964/C/"><strong>Sitting Is a Fat Loss Inhibitor</strong></a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">As the body's <strong>"fight or flight"</strong> muscle, your psoas (hip flexors) is deeply<br />
connected to our natural survival instinct. It instantly tightens in moments<br />
of danger to either protect you (in a fetal position) or help you run,<br />
fueled by the release of adrenaline.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">However, if your psoas (hip flexors) is constantly tight from sitting too much,<br />
it signals to the body you are in constant danger, leading to overworking<br />
of the adrenal gland.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">When this happens, your immune system suffers and your body automatically<br />
switches into fat storing mode in anticipation of danger. Can't shift that weight?<br />
Blame those tight hip flexors known as your "survival muscle".</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://www.livhealthy.co/3~MGs-k_6127b964/C/"><strong>If You Sit Too Much  You're Having Trouble Losing Fat Try This:</strong></a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">If you have a desk job, drive to work or like to relax on the couch,<br />
congratulations you're like a lot of other people. Sure you can decrease<br />
the amount of time you spend sitting but overall there's no way around it.<br />
<br />
So what should you do?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Personally I recommend that you <strong>incorporate these 10 Simple Moves</strong> into<br />
your day. They take less than 15-minutes and can unlock your hip flexors<br />
(survival muscle) so that you're not stuck in fat storing mode.</p>
