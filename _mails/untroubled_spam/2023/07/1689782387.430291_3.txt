Hello *Untroubled.org* Team,

I would like to have a discussion with you regarding the web promotion
strategy for your website Untroubled.org. We wish to work out a proposal to
strengthen the online presence of your website, via a strategically planned
web promotion campaign. In today=E2=80=99s online era, you should be focusi=
ng on
the new revolutionary ways of generating traffic (and subsequently, leads).

We are curious to know if you are aware that a few issues bugging your
website and sorting out these will help you get the best returns out of
your website.

1. Your website seems to be attracting traffic, but this traffic is almost
stagnant and limited, which affects potential sales as you move forward.
2. Your website doesn=E2=80=99t feature in Google's first search page for s=
ome of
the major keywords in your niche, which affects visibility and your
business.
3. Your website has been diagnosed with On-Page and On-Site issues, which
affects the ranking.
4. Your backlinks profile is not efficient enough to help your search
engine visibility.
5. Your website is currently not being properly promoted online according
to Google=E2=80=99s new guidelines (after the latest Google Panda & Penguin
update), which is affecting your marketing strategy and goals.
6. Your presence in the social media platform is minimal. This is depriving
you of a huge market of prospective referral clients.
7. Your website may be penalized by Google.
8. Social media profiles are not updated regularly.
9. A low number of internal and external quality links present on your
website.
10. Not updating fresh contents for your website and blogs as per the
latest Google guideline (Penguin & Panda).
And many more...

We are experts in running a promotional online marketing campaign for
websites. We have a host of ethical services and techniques, which you can
utilize to improve your website's performance.

Also, let me update you that our service prices are very affordable and
cost-effective which will come up within your budget.

We are also doing website designing and redesigning with affordable cost
and fast delivery within 2 weeks. As we are familiar with search
engine guidelines, the website will be search engine friendly and
technically sound. Also, we are giving 3 months of free website maintenance
service.

If there is/are any bad reviews regarding you/your website, our ORM
campaign will help you to push down the bad reviews from 1st page to 3rd
page within 45 days of the campaign.

If my proposal sounds interesting for your business goal, feel free to
email me, or can provide me with your phone number, Whatsapp number or
Skype Id and the best time to call you.

I would be very glad to hear back from you.


Best Regards,
*Jean *
Search Engine Consultant
