Great "secret" spot to grab some tasty drinks and Mexican food in a funky u=
pstairs loft bar in Cohasset.  We tried many of the margaritas, inxluding o=
ne of their non alcoholic ones, and they were all good.  Also tried the tot=
opos nachos, the shrimp taco, and the baja fish taco - all yummy.  Will def=
initely be back! It's an OK location and venue is nice enough.  The selecti=
on of microbrews is pretty good.  The people are nice.  I've had the quesad=
illa and nachos; the taste brings you back to . . . . . . Taco Bell.  No co=
mplaint about the quality of ingredients.  If Mexican is a core to the food=
 service, the owner and chef need to spend some time at a good Mexican rest=
araunts.  Examples: Ciello or El Sarape in Braintree, Cancun in Kingston.  =
It's remarkably bland.  The rest of the menu may very well be good, and bri=
ng people back regularly.  The prices seem otherwise quite fair.  Best of l=
uck to the ownership.  It may be fitting your tastes, YMMV went back.  Brou=
ght people from out of town.  It was better! The huevos rancheros was SO GO=
OD.  So were the margaritas.  Sorry for being so critical last time.  You'r=
e redeemed for me but not for the abused vinyl! Everyone enjoyed themselves=
  Thumbs up!
This had to be one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had.  We were=
 initially lured by a Phantom Gourmet piece that gave this place high marks=
  This place was not only dirty, the food was at best, poor bar food that =
lacked any sense of freshness.  The chips were accompanied by tasteless sal=
sa, dry guacamole, and a hot mystery sauce that tasted like glue.  The maga=
rita was so bland that it tasted as though it came out of an old, pre-mixed=
 bottle.  When it was substituted for a Modelo beer, the beer arrived flat.=
  The enchiladas we ordered were decently presented as were the fajitas but=
 again, lacked any meaningful taste.  This is not a restaurant that we'll b=
e returning to nor should you add it to your destination as well.  This hid=
den gem is well-worth driving with its awesome ambiance, vibe, and food.  T=
he relaxed atmosphere and fact that it's tucked away on the first floor giv=
es it this unique feel inside and the Mexican menu and tropical drinks will=
 make you feel like you're on vacation.  Service was excellent and attentiv=
e, and the outdoor seating area is great although the tables are a little o=
n the smaller side.  The vast indoor area has some awesome posters and viny=
l decorations and a nice long bar where you can enjoy some food and crush s=
ome island-inspired drinks.  My taco salad ($17. 95) was both ample and tas=
ty as was my wife's daily special which was a chimichanga ($19. 95).  Their=
 chips and guac ($9. 95) were also super tasty as was our hibiscus Mai Tai =
($13).  My kid also dug the quesadilla and rice option they had alongside a=
 few other available dishes on the kids menu.  Marisol was awesome and we'l=
l definitely be back.  5 STARS.  I read the reviews before coming here and =
I understand why the ratings are so high.  You can tell from the time you a=
re greeted at the doorstep by Sidy who I believe was the manager you could =
see they are extremely focused on satisfying their customers.  We were a pa=
rty of three and he remembered everyone's names and thanked everyone by nam=
e as we left.  Beautifully decorated front with flowers and the outdoor sea=
ting is tastefully done.  We were there for a 5 pm reservation and by 7 pm =
the restaurant was packed inside and out.  Plenty of staff on hand and they=
 took care of everyone seamlessly Very flavorful food it was very good alth=
ough none stood out from any of the better restaurants I've eaten at.  Grea=
t service as mentioned, clean, extremely cordial staff, they keep their bat=
hrooms spotless and there was great summer vibe.  You can see the staff is =
very well trained, work well together as a team, are genuine, and are focus=
ed on the customer.  We started with the grilled calamari and the special m=
ushroom risotto.  The risotto was a main and we split it three ways.  For e=
ntrees we had the salmon, the filet mignon and the lamb.  They gave us opti=
ons for the sides which was nice, they also accommodated us by providing a =
table in the main dining space even though the table we wanted was reserved=
 for a party of five.  Very accommodating and we felt like they really care=
d that we felt comfortable.  I will admit we were had some unusual requests=
 and our waitress Shirley was very accommodating.  They checked on us throu=
ghout the meal and we never had to find our wait staff.  We felt very comfo=
rtable.  It was a great night and I would highly recommend them for a fun e=
xperience.  They also advertise that they have live entertainment on Saturd=
ay afternoon.=20
