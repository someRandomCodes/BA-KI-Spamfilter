Attention: Beneficiary
once again I try to notify you as my earlier letter was returned
undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email
address on the WILL, I wish to notify you that the late Robert, made
you a beneficiary in his Last WILL {amount is withheld for security
reason}in the Codicil, This may sound strange . Being a widely
traveled man, he said he met you sometime in the past.
Please if I reach you as I am hopeful, endeavor to get back to me.
Regards
Graig Campbell Esq
