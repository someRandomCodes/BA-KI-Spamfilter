In 1997, the mammals were comprehensively revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, which has resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa, that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the groupings.

In the following list, extinct groups are labelled with a In phylogenetics, the crown group or crown assemblage is a collection of species composed of the living representatives of the collection, the most recent common ancestor of the collection, and all descendants of the most recent common ancestor. It is thus a way of defining a clade, a group consisting of a species and all its extant or extinct descendants. For example, Neornithes (birds) can be defined as a crown group, which includes the most recent common ancestor of all modern birds, and all of its extant or extinct descendants.

The concept was developed by Willi Hennig, the formulator of phylogenetic systematics, as a way of classifying living organisms relative to their extinct relatives in his "Die Stammesgeschichte der Insekten", and the "crown" and "stem" group terminology was coined by R. P. S. Jefferies in 1979. Though formulated in the 1970s, the term was not commonly used until its reintroduction in 2000 by Graham Budd an

<br />
The biggest threat to your family&rsquo;s safety and America&rsquo;s National Security right now is NOT Russia&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s NOT North Korea&#39;s advancing nuclear capability.<br />
<br />
<u>It&#39;s NOT even terrorism.</u><br />
<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
The biggest threat to your safety right now is <strong><a href="http://serviceplushomewarranty.shop/4TyHJjeJGp4mw-hbZYQYYsj3fpmMyfKxzqSXOHRpihng9l85YA" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank">this</a></strong><br />
