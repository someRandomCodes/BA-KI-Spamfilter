In 1997, the mammals were comprehensively revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, which has resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa, that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the groupings.

In the following list, extinct groups are labelled with a In phylogenetics, the crown group or crown assemblage is a collection of species composed of the living representatives of the collection, the most recent common ancestor of the collection, and all descendants of the most recent common ancestor. It is thus a way of defining a clade, a group consisting of a species and all its extant or extinct descendants. For example, Neornithes (birds) can be defined as a crown group, which includes the most recent common ancestor of all modern birds, and all of its extant or extinct descendants.

The concept was developed by Willi Hennig, the formulator of phylogenetic systematics, as a way of classifying living organisms relative to their extinct relatives in his "Die Stammesgeschichte der Insekten", and the "crown" and "stem" group terminology was coined by R. P. S. Jefferies in 1979. Though formulated in the 1970s, the term was not commonly used until its reintroduction in 2000 by Graham Budd an

<div style="width:500px;font-size:17px; padding:18px; font-family:serif;text-align:left; ">Hey<br />
<br />
Amazon has a habit of BANNING natural remedies they don&rsquo;t like.<br />
<br />
Especially ones that threaten &ldquo;Big Pharma&rdquo; profits...<br />
<br />
Which makes sense if you think about it.<br />
<br />
Just this last year&hellip;<br />
<br />
<b>Amazon started selling prescription drugs.</b><br />
<br />
Could that be why they recently banned CBD?<br />
<br />
Or why they are trying to ban NAC (N-Acetylcysteine)?<br />
<br />
(NAC is an essential amino acid. It&rsquo;s crucial to keep your immune system healthy and on-the-ready.)<br />
<br />
I can&rsquo;t say for sure, I don&rsquo;t work at Amazon.<br />
<br />
But I can say this...<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they ban <a href="http://brainfortifys.shop/t2QmGtqgXbrwzugnaV8MM1sJLVRJ_Pl_jLeUlJSXtX3CIlsHbQ" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank"><b>---&gt; THIS Ancient African Serum.</b> </a><br />

<br />
<b>Just a few drops</b> of this serum can erase fat like it never existed...<br />
<br />
Thousands of women and men across the country have been getting unreal results with it...<br />
<br />
Katie <b>lost 42 lbs</b> in just 5-weeks...<br />
<br />
David <b>lost 46 lbs</b> and now has more energy to play with his grandkids...<br />
<br />
And Linda lost <b>a staggering 49 pounds! </b><br />
<br />
The best part?<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s actually safe - and clinically proven.<br />

<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
John<br />
<br />
P.S. Every day I feel like Amazon is one step closer to taking over the world.<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s why I always keep 6 bottles of this stuff on hand - just in case Amazon, Big Pharma and the FDA decide to ban it.<br />

<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:9px;">An advantage of this approach is that declaring Theropoda to be birds (or Pan-aves) is more specific than declaring it to be a member of the Archosauria, which would not exclude it from the Crocodilia branch. Basal branch names such as Avemetatarsalia are usually more obscure. However, not so advantageous are the facts that &quot;Pan-Aves&quot; and &quot;Aves&quot; are not the same group, the circumscription of the concept of &quot;Pan-Aves&quot; (synonymous with Avemetatarsalia) is only evident by examination of the above tree, and calling both groups &quot;birds&quot; is ambiguous. Stem mammals are those in the lineage leading to living mammals, together with side branches, from the divergence of the lineage from the Sauropsida to the last common ancestor of the living mammals. This group includes the synapsids as well as mammaliaforms like the morganucodonts and the docodonts; the latter groups have traditionally and anatomically been considered mammals even though they fall outside the crown group mammals. Stem tetrapods are the animals belonging to the lineage leading to tetrapods from their divergence from the lungfish, our nearest relatives among the fishes. In addition to a series of lobe-finned fishes, they also include some of the early labyrinthodonts. Exactly what labyrinthodonts are in the stem group tetrapods rather than the corresponding crown group is uncertain, as the phylogeny of early tetrapods is not well understood. This example shows that crown and stem group definitions are of limited value when there is no consensus phylogeny. Stem arthropods constitute a group that has seen attention in connection with the Burgess Shale fauna. Several of the finds, including the enigmatic Opabinia and Anomalocaris have some, though not all, features associated with arthropods, and are thus considered stem arthropods. The sorting of the Burgess Shale fauna into various stem groups finally enabled phylogenetic sorting of this enigmatic assemblage and also allowed for identifying velvet worms as the closest living relatives of arthropods</span><br />
