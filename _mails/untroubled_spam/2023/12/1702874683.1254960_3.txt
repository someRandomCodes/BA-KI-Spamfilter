<p><b style="font: 7.5px Neue Haas Grotesk Text Pro; color: #6495ED;">The fish dreamed of escaping the fishbowl and into the toilet where he saw his go.He said he was not there yesterday; however, many people saw him there.The book is in front of the table.The busker hoped that the people passing by would throw mone y, but they threw tomatoes instead, so he exchanged his hat for a juicer.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.There&#39;s a message for if you look up.There&#39;s a reason that roses have thorns.She insisted that cleaning out your closet was the key to good driving.Tomorrow will bring something , so as a memory.The bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny&#39;s head by mere millimeters.Just because the water is red doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t drink it.They throw cabbage that turns your brain into emotional baggage.It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.I know many children ask for a pony, but I wanted a bicycle with rockets strapped to it.she wanted was the answer, but she had no idea how much she would hate it.The ice-cream trucks bring back bad memories for of us.Going from child, to childish, to childlike is a matter of time.He stepped gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other side.Her fragrance of choice was fresh garlic.I want to a onesie&hellip; but know it &rsquo;t suit me.The crowd yells and screams for more memes.Be careful with that butter knife.Her in the confines of the house became her normal.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.The elderly neighborhood became enraged over the coyotes who had been blamed for the poodle&rsquo;s disappearance.Before he moved to the inner city, he had always believed that security complexes were psychological.After exploring the abandoned building, he started to believe in ghosts.He enjoys practicing his ballet in the bathroom.There aren&#39;t enough towels in the world to the sewage flowing from his mouth.</b></p>
