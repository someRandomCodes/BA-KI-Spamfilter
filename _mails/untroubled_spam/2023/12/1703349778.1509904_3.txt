<p><b style="font: 9.5px Trebuchet MS; color: #737CA1;">I would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice.The sudden rainstorm washed crocodiles into the ocean.He walked into the basement with the horror movie from the night before playing in his head.The stench from the feedlot permeated the car despite having the air conditioning on recycled air.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.I can&#39;t believe this is the eighth time I&#39;m smashing my piggy on the same day!There&#39;s a reason that roses have thorns.He found the end of the rainbow and was surprised at what he found there.He was % into fasting with her until he understood that meant he couldn&#39;t eat.You&#39;ve been eyeing me day and waiting for your move like a lion stalking a gazelle in a savannah.It&#39;s comforting to know that your fate depends on something as unpredictable as the popping of corn.It was a slippery slope and he was willing to slide the way to the deepest depths.It isn&#39;t difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.Peter found road kill an excellent way to on dinner.Karen believed al trafic laws should be obeyed by ll except herself.People who insist on picking their teeth with their elbows are so annoying!Carol drank the blood as if she were a vampire.The beach was crowded with snow leopards.Having no hair made him look even hairier.I had a in high school named Rick Shaw, but he was fairly useless as a mode of transport.Mary realized if her calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than her computer browser history.Joe discovered that cones make excellent megaphones.We&#39;re careful about orange ping pong balls because people might think they&#39;re fruit.The shark-infested South Pine channel was the way in or out.Douglas figured best way to succeed was to do the opposite of what he&#39;d been doing his .It was getting dark, and we weren&rsquo;t there yet.Red is greener than purple, for sure.The murder hornet was disappointed by the preconceived ideas people had of him.The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask to the gentleman&rsquo;s back.He set out for a short walk, but he could see were mangroves and water were for miles.</b></p>
