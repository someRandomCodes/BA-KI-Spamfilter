Beloved One,

My name is Mrs. Elizabeth Patton, and I found your email address through an Internet search in an online e-mail database directory. We don't know each other, but my spirit led me to write you this email. I am a dying, sick woman, and I'm writing from my sick bed. I want to donate $2,400,000 United States dollars to you for charity work all over the world.

I am writing to you with heavy tears in my eyes and great sorrow in my heart because my doctor informed me that it will only take the will of God for me to survive due to my complicated health issues (cancer). Based on this, I want to transfer my late husband's inheritance fund of $2,400,000 United States dollars to a faithful and God-fearing person who will use it according to my and my late husband's wishes, as we have no child after so many years of marriage.

I want you to use the funds for charity causes, while 15% will be yours to keep as compensation for taking on this responsibility to help mankind. A lot of people are suffering right now in the world, and I want you to use this money to help as many people as possible. The expenses should be made to charities such as orphanages, homes for motherless babies' homes, poor widows, the disabled, humanitarian causes, and people who need money to revive the economy or business.

I will wait to hear from you to see if you can handle this task with honesty and in good faith.

Warm wishes.
Mrs. Elizabeth Patton
