ning a new contract with Republic Records, Swift began re-recording her first six studio albums in November 2020.[31] The decision followed a public 2019 dispute between Swift and talent manager Scooter Braun, who acquired Big Machine Records, including the masters of Swift's albums which the label had released.[32][33] By re-recording the albums, Swift had full ownership of the new masters, which enabled her to control the licensing of her songs for commercial use and therefore substituted the Big Machine–owned masters.[34] Swift and Christopher Rowe produced the re-recorded track, which was recorded by David Payne at Black Bird and Prime Recording Studios in Nashville. Rowe recorded Swift's lead vocals at her home studio in London, and Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. John Hanes engineered the track, and Derek Garten and Lowell Reynolds were credited as additional engineers. Instruments and their corresponding musicians on the re-recording include acoustic guitar (Mike Meadows), bass guitar (Amos Heller), drums (Matt Billingslea), piano (Paul Sidoti), and string (Jonathan Yudkin).[35] The re-recording of "White Horse", subtitled "Taylor's Version", was released as part of Fearless's re-recording, Fearless (Taylor's Version).[36] Swift contacted singer-songwriters Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray to preview a snippet of "White Horse (Taylor's Version)" on their social media on April 8, 2021,[37] one day before Republic Records released Fearless (Taylor's Version).[38] "White Horse (Taylor's Version)" charted in Canada (72)[27] and Australia (99),[39] and it peaked at number 111 on the Billboard Global 200.[40] In the United States, the re-recorded song peaked at number two on Bubbling Under Hot 100[41] and numb
