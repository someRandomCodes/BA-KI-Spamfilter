Regardless if you believe in God or not, this is a "must-read"
message!!=


Throughout history, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to=

come to this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Di=
d you know that the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?=


In Revelation 13:16-18, we read,

"He (the false prophet who dece=
ives many by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and g=
reat, rich and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right han=
d or on their foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who h=
as the mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Her=
e is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the be=
ast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666."

Speaking to th=
e last generation, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why=
? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive =
the mark of the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy o=
r sell with one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict=
 scripture that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!

These verses=
 could not be referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture refere=
nces two physical locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark=
 will be on one "OR" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it wou=
ld indicate both places, not one OR the
other.

This is where it come=
s together. It is shocking how accurate the Bible
is concerning the impla=
ntable RFID microchip. These are notes from a
man named Carl Sanders who =
worked with a team of engineers to help
develop this RFID chip

"Carl=
 Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
heads-of-state of=
ficials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to discuss pl=
ans on how to bring about this one-world system.
The government commissio=
ned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and controlling th=
e peoples of the world=E2=80=94a microchip
that could be inserted under t=
he skin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient method that would b=
e gradually accepted by society).

Carl Sanders, with a team of enginee=
rs behind him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dollars, took on th=
is project and designed a
microchip that is powered by a lithium battery,=
 rechargeable through
the temperature changes in our skin. Without the kn=
owledge of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the time), t=
hese
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing research on the=

best and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.

Gues=
s what? These researchers found that the forehead and the back of
the han=
d (the two places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just
the most =
convenient places, but are also the only viable places for
rapid, consist=
ent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the
lithium battery. The =
microchip is approximately seven millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters i=
n diameter, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is capable of storing p=
ages upon pages of information about
you. All your general history, work =
history, criminal record, health
history, and financial data can be store=
d on this chip.

Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he=
 regretfully
helped design, is the =E2=80=9Cmark=E2=80=9D spoken about in=
 Revelation
13:16=E2=80=9318. The original Greek word for =E2=80=9Cmark=
=E2=80=9D is =E2=80=9Ccharagma,=E2=80=9D
which means a =E2=80=9Cscratch o=
r etching.=E2=80=9D It is also interesting to note
that the number 666 is=
 actually a word in the original Greek. The word
is =E2=80=9Cchi xi stigm=
a,=E2=80=9D with the last part, =E2=80=9Cstigma,=E2=80=9D also meaning
=
=E2=80=9Cto stick or prick.=E2=80=9D Carl believes this is referring to a=

hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to inject the
microchip=
."

Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen if the lithium contain=
ed
within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by=

saying a terrible sore would appear in that location. This is what the=

book of Revelation says:

"And the first (angel) went, and poured ou=
t his vial on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore on th=
e men which had the mark
of the beast, and on them which worshipped his i=
mage" (Revelation
16:2).

You can read more about it here--and to als=
o understand the mystery
behind the number 666: TRUTHBIBLE.US

edu-wisc.us/index.php/campaigns/np293hyjydbb1/track-url/vw641xt1btb86/fd76c=
98bc5c4d252b4f8f7c764c1958b001ca799]

The third angel's warning in Reve=
lation 14:9-11 states,

"Then a third angel followed them, saying with =
a loud voice, 'If
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives h=
is mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of th=
e wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cu=
p of
His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in th=
e
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
=
smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
da=
y or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the=
 mark of his name.'"

Great hope is in our midst, and is coming in a mi=
ghty way--the
greatest revival for Jesus in the history of the world wher=
e we will
see the most souls come to Him of all tribes, tongues, nations,=
 and
peoples (Rev. 7:9-10); for we have this promise in God's Word in the=

midst of these dark times:

"Then I saw an angel coming down from he=
aven, having the key to the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.=
 He laid hold of the
dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Sa=
tan, and bound him
for a thousand years (not literal--rather a spiritual =
label for time
spent in eternity); and he cast him into the bottomless pi=
t, and shut
him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the =
nations
no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these th=
ings
he must be released for a little while (when the Antichrist and fals=
e
prophet will rise up and God will test the world)." (Revelation
20:1-=
3)

"The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to the=

working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with
a=
ll unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not
rec=
eive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this
reason=
 God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe
the lie, th=
at they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth
but had pleasu=
re in unrighteousness." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)"

Who is Barack Obama,=
 and why is he still around?

So what's in the name? The meaning of som=
eone's name can say a lot
about a person. God throughout history has give=
n names to people that
have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How a=
bout the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding bene=
ath the surface.

Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like l=
ightning from
heaven."

The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightnin=
g": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q"
(baw-rawk)

In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, w=
e read about Lucifer (Satan) saying
in his heart:

"I will ascend abo=
ve the heights of the clouds, I will be like the
Most High."

In the =
verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times
it mention=
s him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew
word for the he=
ights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116:
"bamah"--Pronounced (b=
am-maw')

In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated =
as a "U"
or "O," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concep=
ts
together. So to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)=

and a high place like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
l=
etter "U" or "O" would be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U"
Bam-Ma=
w in Hebrew poetry similar to the style written in Isaiah, would
translat=
e literally to "Lightning from the heights." The word "Satan"
in Hebrew i=
s a direct translation, therefore "Satan."

So when Jesus told His disc=
iples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan
fall like lightning from heaven,=
 if this were to be spoken by a Jewish
Rabbi today influenced by the poet=
ry in the book of Isaiah, he would
say these words in Hebrew--the words o=
f Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.

The na=
mes of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we
were to wri=
te those names backward (the devil does things in reverse)
we would get "=
ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the letters that spell
"Alah" (Allah bei=
ng the false god of Islam), we get "I am Satan".
Coincidence? I don't thi=
nk so.

Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the ho=
rizon
in the west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. I=
n
Islam, they have their own messiah that they are waiting for called
t=
he 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one
prophec=
y concerning this man's appearance is the sun rising in the
west.

"T=
hen I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the
everlas=
ting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to
every na=
tion, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice,
'Fear =
God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has
come; and wor=
ship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs
of water.'" (Reve=
lation 14:6-7)

Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts rega=
rding His
death, burial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,00=
0
languages, and nothing comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)?
B=
ecause the same Spirit of God (YHVH) who created all people likewise
tran=
scends all people; therefore the power of His Word is not limited
by peop=
le; while all other religions are man-made, therefore they tend
to primar=
ily stay within their own culture. The same God who speaks to
all people =
through His creation of the heavens and earth that draws
all people aroun=
d the world likewise has sent His Word to the ends of
the earth so that w=
e may come to personally know Him to be saved in
spirit and in truth thro=
ugh His Son Jesus Christ.

Jesus stands alone among the other religions=
 that say to rightly weigh
the scales of good and evil and to make sure y=
ou have done more good
than bad in this life. Is this how we conduct ours=
elves justly in a
court of law? Bearing the image of God, is this how we =
project this
image into reality?

Our good works cannot save us. If w=
e step before a judge, being guilty
of a crime, the judge will not judge =
us by the good we have done, but
rather by the crimes we have committed. =
If we as fallen humanity,
created in God's image, pose this type of justi=
ce, how much more a
perfect, righteous, and Holy God?

God has brough=
t down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given
to Moses at Mt. S=
iani. These laws were not given so we may be
justified, but rather that w=
e may see the need for a savior. They are
the mirror of God's character o=
f what He has written in our hearts,
with our conscious bearing witness t=
hat we know that it is wrong to
steal, lie, dishonor our parents, murder,=
 and so forth.

We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandm=
ents, but we
will never catch up to them to be justified before a Holy Go=
d. That
same word of the law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 year=
s ago
in the body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our justification by
f=
ulfilling the law, living a sinless perfect life that only God could
fulf=
ill.

The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own=

merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of=

God. And if we are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us
u=
p being the one to justify us. As in the court of law, if someone
steps i=
n and pays our fine, even though we are guilty, the judge can
do what is =
legal and just and let us go free. That is what Jesus did
almost 2,000 ye=
ars ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction being
fulfilled in the s=
piritual realm by the shedding of His blood with His
last word's on the c=
ross crying out, "It is finished!" (John 19:30).

For God takes no plea=
sure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23).
This is why in Isaiah ch=
apter 53, where it speaks of the coming
Messiah and His soul being a sacr=
ifice for our sins, why it says it
pleased God to crush His only begotten=
 Son.

This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being=

poured out upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would
=
all perish to hell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it
out=
 on His Son whose soul could not be left in Hades but was raised
and seat=
ed at the right hand of God in power.

So now when we put on the Lord J=
esus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God
no longer sees the person who deser=
ves His wrath, but rather the
glorious image of His perfect Son dwelling =
in us, justifying us as if
we received the wrath we deserve, making a way=
 of escape from the
curse of death; now being conformed into the image of=
 the heavenly man
walking in a new nature, and no longer in the image of =
the fallen man
Adam.

Now what we must do is repent and put our trust=
 and faith in the
savior, confessing and forsaking our sins, and to recei=
ve His Holy
Spirit that we may be born again (for Jesus says we must be b=
orn again
to see and enter the Kingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is=
 not
just head knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather receiving His=

words, taking them to heart, so that we may truly be transformed into
=
the image of God. Where we no longer live to practice sin, but rather
tur=
n from our sins and practice righteousness through faith in Him in
obedie=
nce to His Word by reading the Bible.

Our works cannot save us, but th=
ey can condemn us; it is not that we
earn our way into everlasting life, =
but that we obey our Lord Jesus
Christ:

Jesus says,

=E2=80=
=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall enter t=
he
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.
=
Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophesie=
d
in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in
=
Your name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew =
you;
depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21=
-23)

"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salva=
tion
to all who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)

"Now I saw a new heaven and=
 a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. A=
lso there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem=
, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her=
 husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the taber=
nacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be =
His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will =
wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor s=
orrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things hav=
e passed away.'

Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make al=
l things new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and fa=
ithful.'

And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega,=
 the
Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of=

life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
thi=
ngs, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbe=
lieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, a=
nd all liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and =
brimstone, which is the second death.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8)

tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in=
 the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever a=
nd ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his =
image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"<br />
<br />
Great hope is in our midst, and is coming in a mighty way--the greatest rev=
ival for Jesus in the history of the world where we will see the most souls=
 come to Him of all tribes, tongues, nations, and peoples (Rev. 7:9-10); fo=
r we have this promise in God's Word in the midst of these dark times:<br /=

<br />
"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottoml=
ess pit and a great chain in his hand. He laid hold of the dragon, that ser=
pent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years=
 (not literal--rather a spiritual label for time spent in eternity); and he=
 cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, =
so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were =
finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while (wh=
en the Antichrist and false prophet will rise up and God will test the worl=
d)." (Revelation 20:1-3)<br />
<br />
"The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to the working=
 of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteo=
us deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love =
of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send t=
hem strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be=
 condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousnes=
s." (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)"<br />
<br />
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still around?<br />
<br />
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot about a =
person. God throughout history has given names to people that have a specif=
ic meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us tak=
e a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, "...I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."=
<br />
<br />
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for "lightning": "ba=CC=82ra=CC=82q" (baw-r=
awk)<br />
<br />
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying in his=
 heart:<br />
<br />
"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most Hig=
h."<br />
<br />
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times it me=
ntions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew word for the=
 heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116: "bamah"--Pronounced (=
bam-maw')<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the letter "Waw" or "Vav" is often transliterated as a "U" or "O=
," and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts together. So =
to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq) and a high place =
like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the letter "U" or "O" would=
 be used. So, Baraq "O" Bam-Maw or Baraq "U" Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry simil=
ar to the style written in Isaiah, would translate literally to "Lightning =
from the heights." The word "Satan" in Hebrew is a direct translation, ther=
efore "Satan."<br />
<br />
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan fall li=
ke lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish Rabbi today=
 influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would say these words i=
n Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I saw Satan as Baraq O B=
am-Maw.<br />
<br />
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we were to=
 write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse) we would get=
 "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah bei=
ng the false god of Islam), we get "I am Satan". Coincidence? I don't think=
 so.<br />
<br />
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon in the=
 west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In Islam, they =
have their own messiah that they are waiting for called the 12th Imam, or t=
he Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one prophecy concerning this ma=
n's appearance is the sun rising in the west.<br />
<br />
"Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlas=
ting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth=E2=80=94to every nati=
on, tribe, tongue, and people=E2=80=94 saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God =
and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship H=
im who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.'" (Revelation 1=
4:6-7)<br />
<br />
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His death, bur=
ial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000 languages, and nothi=
ng comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)? Because the same Spirit of =
God (YHVH) who created all people likewise transcends all people; therefore=
 the power of His Word is not limited by people; while all other religions =
are man-made, therefore they tend to primarily stay within their own cultur=
e. The same God who speaks to all people through His creation of the heaven=
s and earth that draws all people around the world likewise has sent His Wo=
rd to the ends of the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to b=
e saved in spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh the =
scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good than bad i=
n this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a court of law? Bea=
ring the image of God, is this how we project this image into reality?<br /=
>
<br />
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty of a=
 crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but rather by=
 the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's i=
mage, pose this type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Ho=
ly God?<br />
<br />
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given to Mo=
ses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be justified, but rat=
her that we may see the need for a savior. They are the mirror of God's cha=
racter of what He has written in our hearts, with our conscious bearing wit=
ness that we know that it is wrong to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, mur=
der, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we will ne=
ver catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That same word of t=
he law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago in the body of Jes=
us Christ. He came to be our justification by fulfilling the law, living a =
sinless perfect life that only God could fulfill.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own merit, bu=
t the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. And if w=
e are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us up being the one to=
 justify us. As in the court of law, if someone steps in and pays our fine,=
 even though we are guilty, the judge can do what is legal and just and let=
 us go free. That is what Jesus did almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It=
 was a legal transaction being fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shed=
ding of His blood with His last word's on the cross crying out, "It is fini=
shed!" (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). This =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to crush Hi=
s only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would all perish to h=
ell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it out on His Son whose=
 soul could not be left in Hades but was raised and seated at the right han=
d of God in power.<br />
<br />
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God no lo=
nger sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image =
of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if we received the wrat=
h we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death; now being con=
formed into the image of the heavenly man walking in a new nature, and no l=
onger in the image of the fallen man Adam.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the savior, co=
nfessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy Spirit that we may=
 be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again to see and enter the K=
ingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not just head knowledge of believ=
ing in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart, so that=
 we may truly be transformed into the image of God. Where we no longer live=
 to practice sin, but rather turn from our sins and practice righteousness =
through faith in Him in obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.<br />
<br />
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we earn o=
ur way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus Christ:<br />
<br />
Jesus says,<br />
<br />
=E2=80=9CNot everyone who says to Me, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord,=E2=80=99 shall e=
nter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven=
. Many will say to Me in that day, =E2=80=98Lord, Lord, have we not prophes=
ied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Yo=
ur name?=E2=80=99 And then I will declare to them, =E2=80=98I never knew yo=
u; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!=E2=80=99 (Matthew 7:21-23)=
<br />
<br />
"And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to al=
l who obey Him." (Hebrews 5:9)<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8)<br />
