  <p>You can still get your ERC Refund for the losses you or your business suffered during the pandemic. This program will expire in 2023 for the financial losses that were incurred during 2020 to 2022!</p> 
  <p>The Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERC) is available to you even if you got the PPP (Paycheck Protection Program). The ERC is on top of that and is not a loan.</p> 
  <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>You or your employer can get up to $26k per W-2 employee</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>We're here to Help get your paperwork filed before the deadline!</strong></span></p> 
  <p>Unlike the PPP,&nbsp;<strong><u>the ERC refund can be spent on anything</u></strong>, bonuses, improvements, equipment, etc.</p> 
  <p>To have one of our specialists review your business' qualifications for free and&nbsp;<u><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">get your initial approval</span></u>, start by filling out the 6 question form at&nbsp;<strong><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" data-id="4454110037" data-title="ERC Website" data-untrack="0" href="http://www.jejjor.monster/4fd4g2395sm8Q610sm7fizJ1ch21eFv4GIf4rxvs4FhIHEsvZ8N9D9KoMe7ETsR10h8gTcYdpPk/electrocutions-apes">the ERTC Information Website</a></strong></p> 
  <p>Here are some examples of recent filings:<br /> - A single location restaurant with 11 employees received a refund of $528,340<br /> - A Home Healthcare business received $5,143,822<br /> - A Temp Staffing Firm with 326 employees received $3,758,980<br /> - A one location Gym with 16 employees received $351,455<br /> - A Toilet Manufacturer with 63 employees received $1,252,104<br /> - A General Contractor with 59 employees received $1,364,283<br /> - A Marketing Graphics Firm with 11 employees received $250,954</p> 
  <p>Almost every business is able to get a substantial rebate!</p> 
  <p>Do you want to&nbsp;<u>maximize your refund</u>? Only an ERC expert can truly maximize your refund and get it to you much faster! When you're talking about the ERC refund, your average tax accountant may only get you $1MM when we can get you $3MM. And they may need to go back and forth with multiple document requests from the IRS.&nbsp;<strong>Are you willing to leave that much money on the table?</strong>&nbsp;And let it drag out due to inexperience.</p> 
  <p><strong>Get your Initial Approval in just a couple of minutes. If you qualify, you will get a Rebate!&nbsp;</strong></p>
