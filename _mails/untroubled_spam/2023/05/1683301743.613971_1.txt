Hello

We are contacting you today to introduce ourselves as direct private lenders for business loans.

Funds are available for land development, business expansion capital, working capital, real property, construction projects, factoring, bank instruments, energy, manufacturing, telecommunications and real estate acquisitions such as hotel and commercial.

We also take a look at the need for financing in a wide variety of other industries as well, such as oil and gas, new technologies, and forestry and mining to name a few.

Our pool of funds is provided by high net worth individuals, trust funds, family office funds as well as corporate and institutional funds. We act as the direct custodian of these funds provided by our clients who request that we operate with the utmost of privacy and discretion. As a result, we normally fund individual projects starting from US$1 million well into the $500-million-dollar range.


To make an informed decision to proceed, we will need to receive your business plan, Executive summary, or prospectus that you can send to us, that would be a good place to start. If approved, funds can be made available to you in as little as 10 banking days.

If you have any questions or are interested, please feel free to contact the undersigned.


Looking forward to your response.

Yours,
Rodney Shank
