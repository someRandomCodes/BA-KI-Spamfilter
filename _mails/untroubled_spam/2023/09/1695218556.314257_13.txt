I just watched this viral video the other day…
http://www.redboostmale.ltd/l/lt9O33027N2705O/3213JF14976Q24097KS986D589167226G1806513255
And I thought I should share it with you:

Man collapsed in train station for a heart attack

It’s about a man who collapsed from a heart attack in a train station.

He was “revived” by a mysterious man… BUT not in the way you’d think.

It wasn’t by using CPR or a defibrillator.

Instead, the mystery man was seen touching the neck of the victim with two fingers.

And a few moments later…

He was breathing normally, like nothing ever happened.

I saw it with my own two eyes, but I still couldn’t believe it.

Now the question is…

What’s this powerful procedure that can “revive a dead man’s heart”?

Why don’t we know about it?

And who IS this mystery man? ?

THIS short viral video reveals it all.

Sincerely,
Frank






Al-Mu'izz was an excellent planner and organizer, and the state he inherited had regained internal stability, after the turmoils of Abu Yazid's revolt.[71] His early reign saw successes against the Byzantines, where the last remaining Byzantine strongholds were extinguished with the Fall of Rometta in 965,[72] as well as the reconquest of the western Maghreb by the Fatimid general Jawhar in 958–960, temporarily expelling Umayyad influence from the region and extending Fatimid rule to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.[73] After these successes, al-Mu'izz once again turned to the abandoned project of the conquest of Egypt. Meticulous military and political preparations were undertaken, and the agents of the Isma'ili da'wa engaged to promote the Fatimid cause in Egypt and suborn officials of the weakened Ikhshidid regime.[61][74] As a result, when the Fatimid army under Jawhar arrived in Egypt in summer 969, it faced little organized resistance. Jawhar entered the Egyptian capital, Fustat, in July 969, and claimed the country for his master.[75] Immediately he began establishing a new capital city near Fustat, which came to be known as al-Qahira al-Mu'izziyya ('the Victorious One of al-Mu'izz'), modern Cairo.[11] Jawhar governed Egypt for the next four years as viceroy of al-Mu'izz, restoring the country's finances.[76] It was not until August 972 that al-Mu'izz left Ifriqiya, appointing the Berber Buluggin ibn Ziri as his viceroy there. In June 973, the Fatimid court arrived in Egypt and al-Mu'izz took up residence in Cair
