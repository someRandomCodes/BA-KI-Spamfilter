New Program Rewards










Giving this 5 stars because our waiter (Trey) was amazing.  Fun personality=
, explained menu well, answered any questions, and never left our cups empt=
y! I only got pictures of the queso unfortunately but we ordered a lot of f=
ood and tried multiple desserts.  Queso was just okay- not great in my opin=
ion.  The ribeye was great! But I did not like the enchiladas on top of it.=
  Was a weird combination to pair together but my brother in law loved it. =
 The chicken fried steak was amazing! HD jalapeo in it for a fun spice kick=
  A great spot in OKC.  I came at an odd time in between lunch and dinner.=
  I would call this stripped-down fine dining.  The quality of service and =
food are on par with any steakhouse, but the atmosphere and entrees lack th=
e pretension of most fine dining restaurants.  I went with the special whic=
h was a pork roast with Parmesan crusted asparagus, fantastic.  I also got =
the blue cheese potato chips which were a richer and lighter take on fully =
loaded chips.  Much better experience this time around.  Actually made it t=
o food this time. !! Got the french toast with a side of bacon & egg Partne=
r did the Cowgirl Benedict Our server Rachel was extremely welcoming super =
helpful with suggestions and explaining the menu items, And gave excellent =
service.  Thank you Cheevers for the delicious & delightful dinning experie=
nce Food was incredible.  Cheever's Cafe is an upscale Southwestern & South=
ern cuisine restaurant in Oklahoma City.  I went on recommendation from som=
e locals.  The restaurant was extremely busy on a Wednesday night, but they=
 had open bar seating where they served the full menu.  I was greeted by Ca=
meron, the bartender, and he told me all about Cheever Cafe's history.  In =
1938, the Cheever's Cafe location was originally a flower shop that was run=
 by the Cheever family for multiple generations.  By 2000, the location tra=
nsformed into the restaurant you see today.  The new owners, Heather and Ke=
ith Paul, kept the former flower shop intact as much as possible.  There's =
a stylish Deco storefront built of limestone and black glass with huge plat=
e glass windows and terrazzo floors.  There is also a 20-foot flower displa=
y cooler in the middle of the cafe where they currently use it for their wi=
nes.  According to Cameron, the restaurant is known for Cheever's Chicken F=
ried Steak and Shrimp and Grits.  He mentioned that Oklahoma City is a new =
hub for filming Hollywood movies, and Leonardo DiCaprio actually came in to=
 try the Cheever's Chicken Fried Steak before.  For dessert, Cameron had re=
commended the Roasted Pecan Ice Cream Ball and the Giant Carrot Cake.  I wa=
