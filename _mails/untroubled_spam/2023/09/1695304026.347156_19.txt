The history of dogs begins with their domestication from wild wolves.  Evid=
ence suggests this momentous event occurred between 20,000 to 40,000 years =
ago, possibly in multiple regions.  Early humans and wolves likely formed a=
 mutualistic relationship; humans provided leftover food, and wolves offere=
d protection and aided in hunting.  Early Roles As humans transitioned from=
 nomadic hunting and gathering to settled agriculture, dogs' roles evolved.=
  They became guardians of livestock, hunting companions, and even modes of=
 transportation by pulling sleds in colder regions. Ancient Civilizations D=
ogs were revered and integrated into many ancient cultures.  The ancient Eg=
yptians, for example, believed that dogs were sacred and often depicted the=
m in art and hieroglyphs.  The Pharaoh's hounds were given elaborate burial=
s, highlighting their significance.  Breeding for Traits Selective breeding=
 began thousands of years ago, as humans desired dogs with specific charact=
eristics for various tasks.  This led to the rise of breeds specialized for=
 hunting, herding, guarding, and companionship.  Dogs in Mythology Througho=
