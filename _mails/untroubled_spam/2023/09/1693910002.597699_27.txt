Landscaping is a wonderful way to enhance the exterior of your home.  The b=
lend of natural elements like flora, stone, and water features can create a=
 serene environment that welcomes you after a long day.  Whether you're foc=
used on gardening or aesthetic arrangements, a well-planned landscape can a=
dd value to your property and enrich your quality of life.  Some modern tra=
ctors also have (or offer as optional equipment) a button on the gear stick=
 for controlling the clutch, in addition to the standard pedal, allowing fo=
r gear changes and the tractor to be brought to a stop without using the fo=
ot pedal to engage the clutch.  Others have a button for temporarily increa=
sing throttle speed to improve hydraulic flow to implements, such as a fron=
t end loader bucket.  Independent left and right brake pedals are provided =
to allow improved steering (by engaging the side one wishes to turn to, slo=
wing or stopping its wheel) and improved traction in soft and slippery cond=
itions (by transferring rotation to the wheel with better grip).  Some user=
s prefer to lock both pedals together, or utilize a partial lock that allow=
s the left pedal to be depressed independently but engages both when the ri=
ght is applied.  This may be in the form of a swinging or sliding bolt that=
 may be readily engaged or disengaged in the field without tools.  Foot ped=
al throttle control is mostly a returning feature of newer tractors.  In th=
e UK, foot pedal use to control engine speed while travelling on the road i=
s mandatory.  Some tractors, especially those designed for row-crop work, h=
ave a 'de-accelerator' pedal, which operates in the reverse fashion of an a=
utomobile throttle, slowing the engine when applied.  This allows control o=
ver the speed of a tractor with its throttle set high for work, as when rep=
eatedly slowing to make U-turns at the end of crop rows in fields.  A front=
-facing foot button is traditionally included just ahead of the driver's se=
at (designed to be pressed by the operator's heel) to engage the rear diffe=
rential lock (diff-lock), which prevents wheel slip.  The differential norm=
ally allows driving wheels to operate at their own speeds, as required, for=
 example, by the different radius each takes in a turn.  This allows the ou=
tside wheel to travel faster than the inside wheel, thereby traveling furth=
er during a turn.  In low-traction conditions on a soft surface, the same m=
echanism can allow one wheel to slip, wasting its torque and further reduci=
ng traction.  The differential lock overrides this, forcing both wheels to =
turn at the same speed, reducing wheel slip and improving traction.  Care m=
ust be taken to unlock the differential before turning, usually by hitting =
the pedal a second time, since the tractor with good traction cannot perfor=
m a turn with the diff-lock engaged.  In many modern tractors, this pedal i=
s replaced with an electrical switch.=20
