What an amazing find! While stuck in Miami on an overnight layover I google=

ith the Burrata Tomaca with focaccia, and the Fried Calamari zucchini appet=
izers.  Super yummy.  Plenty to share.  Not sure we could both eat an entre=

 Fig and Pear Ravioli.  OMG.  So flavorful, tasty, satisfying and with grea=
