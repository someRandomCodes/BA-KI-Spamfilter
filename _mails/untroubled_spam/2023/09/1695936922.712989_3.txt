    <p>The process of roasting transforms green coffee into the aromatic br=
own beans that we purchase in our favorite stores or cafs. The roasting pro=
cess is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the gr=

    <p>Some prefer their coffee light and sweet, while others might enjoy a=
 robust dark roast coffee. The spectrum of coffee roasts is vast, and the d=
egree to which a coffee is roasted determines its flavor profile.</p>=20
    <p>Each type of roast undergoes a distinct process that influences the =
final taste of the coffee. Light roasts are generally lighter in color and =
are roasted for a shorter period of time. They often have a more acidic, fl=
oral, and fruity profile.</p>=20
    <p>Medium roasts are often favored for their balanced flavor, aroma, an=
d acidity. They are roasted until they reach a medium brown color, and typi=
cally lack the grainy taste of light roasts, presenting a more balanced fla=
vor.</p>=20
    <p>Dark roasts are darker in color and are roasted for a longer period.=
 They often have a shiny black color with an oily surface. These roasts fea=
ture pronounced bitterness, and the roasting process often overshadows thei=

 types of coffee are characterized by their intense flavor, low acidity, an=
