This place was a nice surprise while passing through Oklahoma City.  Recent=
ly won a James Beard award so lucky to have happened across it.  Service wa=
s impeccable from the moment we entered.  The host/manager made us feel ver=
y welcome, Portia who greeted us and filled our waters was super friendly, =
and our waitress Sophie was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu=
, never missing a beat with our needs.  We had the chvre appetizer, smoked =
oysters and fried green tomatoes for starters.  All were amazing.  Among ou=
r party we tried the English Beef Rib, Lamb chops on a hummus base (AMAZING=
!), Branzino, Strip Steak and Vegetable Curry.  Everything was a winner.  N=
ot everyone at the table was a fan of walnuts, but that didn't stop the ent=
ire group from consuming the amazing Black Walnut cake at the end.  Stopped=
 just short of licking the bowl! I would make a trip to OKC just to eat her=
e again! Good work Black Walnut! Went there recently and was really disappo=
inted.  We made a reservation for inside at a specific time that they verif=
ied they had indoor seating available.  When we got there, they were like d=
o you want to sit outdoors the tables and bar seating is full.  Fortunately=
 two bar seats became available so we took them.  The grilled oysters were =
just blobs of melted cheese with no taste.  I ordered the cardamom roast be=
ef salad which was excellent followed by the English beef ribs.  The rib wa=
s well cooked but the kale slaw was pretty meh.  My husband got the strip w=
hich was tough and bland.  The side dish Brussel sprouts were tasty, though=
  Between us we got four different cocktails and they were mostly ok.  But=
 nothing I would re-order.  We had pre-dinner cocktails at R and J Supper C=
lub that were better.  The service was pretty middle too.  All and and all =
I was disappointed.  I won't be going back and I'm canceling my Grey Sweate=
r reservation, which has the same executive chef Hi. . . return visitor fro=
m many moons ago.  I've been planning a date with my man for SO LONG to get=
 the tomahawk steak.  We made it happen on a Wednesday night! And I will sa=
y we enjoyed literally everything other than the main course.  Don't get me=
 wrong. . . we are filled to the brim with tasty food.  Highly recommend th=
e OYSTER APP (we could eat 100 if we had the money) and the PORK BELLY APP =
(super sweet and tangy).  Also highly enjoyed the Lobster bites as an appet=
izer (ask for extra lime to squeeze on top).  We believe the steak would ha=
ve been better served intact so we could slice the medium-rare meat and sav=
or the juices.  The mac'n'cheese was perfectly creamy.  The veggies were sw=
eet and tender.  And the DRINKS-- whiskey fans should get the House and the=
 Paper Airplane.  Coffee lovers should sip the ESPRESS-YO-TINI to round off=
 the evening.  Lastly, let's shout out Mr.  Neff and Ms.  Kat who rocked th=
e bar like they owned the place.  We will This spot is amazing! Food, servi=
ce and atmosphere is on point.  You can't really go wrong with any of the f=
ood here.  The oysters are super delicious as well as the salmon, rack of l=
amb and dessert! The drinks are also well balanced and tasty! We had a hank=
ering for some dinner someplace that we knew would offer something new.  Bl=
ack Walnut immediately came to mind.  This was our fourth or fifth visit to=
 Black Walnut.  The food was excellent.  The chef consistently delivers on =
a menu of items that change with the season.  Nothing way out in left field=
 in terms of ingredients.  The quality of the items and the unique preparat=
ion deliver a great meal every time for us.  We shared the chvre, a brussel=
 caesar, and the cast iron strip steak.  All three were outstanding.  We al=
so had a couple of cocktails.  They were good, but focused almost exclusive=
ly on vodka variances.  I preferred the drinks we ordered that are standard=
 fare over the two that we ordered from their menu.  They offer several uni=
que cocktails, but they are almost all based on vodka or flavored vodka for=
 now.  The service was good for us.  The overall dining experience can be s=
omewhat distracting if you have a view of the street due to the total confu=
sion of people trying to figure out where to go.  The host stand isn't by t=
he street side door (which isn't clearly labeled), it's across the restaura=
nt by the elevator from the underground parking hallway.  Additionally, peo=
ple are always walking around outside confused because they are trying to g=
o to the Grey Sweater (in the same building), but pulling on locked doors t=
hat look like they should go somewhere.  The hostess ends up chasing them d=
own outside as they wander up and down the street trying to figure out wher=
e to go.  Go for the food, laugh at the crappy logistics, and order that fa=
vorite drink you have in your head.  You won't be sorry!
