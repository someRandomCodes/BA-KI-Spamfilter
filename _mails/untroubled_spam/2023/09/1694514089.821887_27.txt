Alright, it's time to buckle up and embark on this epicurean journey that I=
'm about to chronicle.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill restaurant review, =
no siree.  This is an adventure, a love story, a comedy, and a culinary exp=
erience all rolled into one.  Ladies and gents, fasten your seatbelts; we'r=
e heading to Whiskey Cake Kitchen and Bar in the heartland of the United St=
ates - Oklahoma City, OK! Picture this: It's a balmy summer's evening.  You=
're in the mood for something fresh, something locally sourced, something y=
ou might call the lovechild of gastronomic genius and Mother Earth herself.=
  You need look no further than Whiskey Cake Kitchen and Bar, a place where=
 the greens are greener, the meats are succulent, and every dish is a saga =
of flavors waiting to unfold.  Your journey begins with Fried Green Tomatoe=
s, a classic staple of Southern cuisine, served here with a sass and charm =
that could charm a coyote out of a cactus patch.  Just when you think the e=
xcitement has peaked, your entrees arrive.  The Rotisserie Farm Bird flies =
onto your plate, the most succulent, juicy chicken you've ever dared to enc=
ounter.  Its partner in culinary crime, the Steak Frites, saunters onto you=
r husband's plate, juicy and tender, and slathered with a white peppercorn =
sauce that could make a French chef weep tears of joy.  And then, the momen=
t of truth: the Whiskey Cake, a dessert so decadent, so divine, it can only=
 be described as borderline erotic.  It's a symphony of flavors that cresce=
ndos in your mouth.  A bite, a sigh, another bite - the world around you fa=
des as you delve into this blissful indulgence.  It's a culinary rapture, a=
 dessert that crosses the line into the realm of sensuality, making you whi=
sper sweet nothings to the spiced pecans, whipped cream, and ice cream that=
 accompany it.  The ambience? Oh, honey, it's as if an urban chic met a cou=
ntry barn, fell in love, and decided to settle down in OKC.  It's hip and d=
own-to-earth, friendly and cool, an oxymoron that somehow works perfectly. =
 And let's talk about service, shall we? Enter stage right, Austin George. =
 The Clark Kent of servers, if you will.  This man serves dishes like Super=
man saves the world - with style, charm, and a degree of dedication that is=
 truly unparalleled.  He's the hero we didn't know we needed, and the one w=
e certainly didn't deserve.  I've been around the block a few times, my fri=
ends, and never - I repeat, NEVER - have I come across service like this.  =
So there you have it folks, a saga of farm-to-table deliciousness that leav=
es you feeling just a little more alive than you were before.  Whiskey Cake=
 Kitchen and Bar is not just a restaurant, it's an experience, a rollercoas=
ter of flavors that grabs hold of your senses and doesn't let go.  So what =
are you waiting for? Pull up a chair, order a plate, and let the culinary a=
dventure begin! And always remember, life's short, eat the Whiskey Cake.  J=
ust do it Solid option for both food and drinks.  Ice atmosphere.  I like t=
he bartenders a lot.  I am not a fan of all their cocktails, but if you're =
honest, they'll make it right.  They take pride in providing good service. =
 Nice atmosphere.  Solid option year round with both indoor and outdoor sea=
ting.  call ahead to ask if a reservation is needed.  They can get quite pa=
cked, although it is a rather large restaurant.  Their fix menu events are =
also very good.  I have gone twice for those and I have been impressed.  I =
wish they prices were a bit lower.  Have I mentioned they have a late happy=
 hour? It's that time a year again, birthday weekend, and Great State Fair =
Contest entries get turned in.  So that means a trip to Oklahoma City and a=
 lupper stop at Whiskey Cake Kitchen by Penn Square Mall.  After dropping o=
ff the entries and making the rounds, we decided to celebrate turn in being=
 done.  My 47th birthday that was Friday, and my late mother and late grand=
mother's birthday that were today( mom would have been 80, and her mother 1=
07).  We could not have asked for a better experience from one of our favor=
ite farm to table eateries in OKC.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a you=
ng hostess in black slacks, a what I will call a grey tank top(she did not =
know we had a state fair.  We accidentally told her the wrong location of t=
he fair grounds, it is at 10th and May.  She said she was going to check or=
 out).  Our waiter Austin was very quick on his feet and very attentive.  M=
y husband and I love the vibe inside(watch for the pictures at the end).  I=
 got the butcher board(which was the perfect size for one person.  It used =
to be so huge that I would end up taking half home in the past).  I also ha=
d the deviled eggs(they change seasonally, this round, it was an elote topp=
ing with cherry tomato. It was delicious).  To drink I had a Bohemian Raspb=
erry cocktail with a single shot of Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Raspberry Simple=
 syrup, Lime, Mint, and ginger beer( it made a refreshing addition to my me=
al along with water that sat on the table in a little milk bottle).  My hus=
band chose sweet tea to drink(which was unsweet tea and a side of simple sy=
rup to sweeten to his liking).  He tried the smoked tri tip dip with a side=
 of mac n cheese.  For dessert, we go a portion of the Whiskey Cake and van=
illa ice cream, with a homemade whipped cream on the side(YUM!).  If you ha=
ve never had the dessert, GET IT! It is a culinary orgasm for your pallet. =
 Each time you enter, it is a surprise at what you will find.  If you are i=
n the OKC area, stop in. (You can find them across social media as well, Fa=
cebook, etc. . . ) Hope you enjoy the brownie recipe, Austin.  Thanks again=
 for making our visit so pleasant and peaceful.=20

ground-color:#BDBDBD;" bgcolor=3D"#BDBDBD"> Love it! Some friends and I had=
 the chance to try out Bar Ciccheti last weekend, and we had the best time.=
 The ambiance is hip, but elegant. Our waitress took great care of us, givi=
ng us some background on the restaurant and providing some recommendations.=
 We split three appetizers and two desserts so we could get a sampling of w=
hat the menu had to offer. We had heard about the crispy cauliflower, and i=
t was surprisingly good, just as we had been told. The honey parmesan ribs =
were sticky and delicious. We also tried the artichoke fonduta, which I als=
o really enjoyed. If you have a sweet tooth, you are sure to love the cooki=
e skillet or the cinnamon roll bread pudding. Both were very sweet, and oh =
so good! We wanted and needed to stop eating, but alas, we could leave no b=
ite left behind. This was really good. We'd been here once before but it ha=
d been a while. The draw then was some live music that performs upstairs. W=
e had forgotten about that and what a nice treat. A 3 piece jazz band added=
 some really nice ambiance to the evening. Food wise I got the Braised Beef=
 Manicotti. I can't even tell you the last time I got manicotti in a restau=
rant. This was really good. Good flavor. It was a little bit spicy so if yo=
u're extra sensitive to that, you'll notice it. The dish is a little small.=
 I could have eaten 3 of them but it's definitely worth getting if you have=
n't before. My wife got the local salad with added steak. Not quite as good=
 as she had hoped. We've gotten this salad before at Osteria and the anchov=
y vinaigrette was awesome. Just wasn't quite as good here. Desert wise I wa=
s a little disappointed. The cookie is kind of thin and as such it was pret=
ty flaky, almost crumbly. The ice cream was good but overall not quite as g=
ood as it looks. I'm more of a pizookie fan where the cookie is thicker, mo=
ist and gooey. All that being said it was a nice atmosphere made even bette=
r by the music. It was good food and I think we'll definitely go back. Chec=
k this place out if you haven't already! Don't get me wrong, I love this pl=
ace. It has good ambience, it's a fun vibe, and it's a nice place to hangou=
t. Usually when I dine in the portions of everything is good and well worth=
 the price, but this night I decided to order takeout and this is what I go=
t. Granted they were getting ready to close, BUT shouldn't you get the same=
 quality and quantity if you dine in. The fish looks like it was from a pac=
kage you'll get at a grocery store and the fires are just side. I've notice=
d that every time I order takeout from here there quantity and quality does=
n't match there dine in portions. I still love this place though, I just wa=
nted to get the word out there... don't order takeout, just dine in! We cam=
e here for a work event with 25 people and they let us use the entire upper=
 floor. This is an amazing space for a party with plenty of room to roam, s=
tand around the bar, and eat at the tables. They let us use drink tickets a=
nd set up a custom prefix menu to hit our budget. The staff was all amazing=
 and super nice. The food was also outstanding. The cauliflower app was so =
good I couldn't even tell what it was. Almost tasted like chicken tenders. =
The goat meatballs were also amazing. Very flavorful and moist. I needed so=
me more tzazaki though. I got the waygu sirloin for my entree and was blown=
 away. There is no way you would know this isn't a $60 steak from the best =
steakhouse in town. The carmal sauce is a must, seriously you have to get i=
t. Their bread pudding was soo good, and I don't even like sweets that much=
 Everyone I was with couldn't stop eating it, so addicting. Be warned. </p=
