Bulk meal prep is an efficient way to save time and money, especially when =
you have a large family or a busy schedule.  It involves cooking large port=
ions of different types of meals and then storing them for future use.  Thi=
s could be as simple as prepping veggies for the week or as elaborate as co=
oking full dinners to store in the freezer.  The idea is to do all the prep=
aration at once to maximize efficiency.  The inventor of meal prep (short f=
or meal preparation) as we know of it today is unknown.  Whereas as we have=
 seen in this article, various versions of meal prep have been adopted thro=
ugh the centuries, the version of meal prep as a tool for managing macronut=
rients and preparing meals ahead of time does not have a precise known orig=
in.  However, the first formal mention of meal prep was in a 1946 newspaper=
 article about a doctor who was teaching his patients how to prepare meals =
ahead of time to eat healthier while going through treatment.  However, we =
were not able to fully verify this claim.  This certainly is the century of=
 true popularisation as before this time meal prep eas mainly a method wide=
spread among niche fitness communities.  In the 2000s, meal prepping has be=
come more accessible thanks to the rise of social media platforms such as I=
nstagram and Facebook, which helped to promote this healthy lifestyle among=
 the wider population.  As people became busier and busier and as people's =
lives became more sedentary, meal prep's main attraction was to make health=
y food accessible to people who were too busy to cook and needed to become =
fitter.  In recent years, meal kits were introduced as a way for people to =
take advantage of this trend.  Companies worldwide started meal prep servic=
es to make life easier and healthier for busy people.  In 2020 in the UK, t=
he market value of meal kits is estimated at around 1bn.  Meal prep has tak=
