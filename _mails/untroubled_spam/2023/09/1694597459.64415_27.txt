Great dinner, quick service and excellent food.  Everything was fresh and s=
uper flavorful.  The portions and presentation were excellent.  We dined in=
 and the dining room was basically empty but there was a ton of takeout tra=
ffic so it's nice to see they're still staying busy and will hopefully stic=
k around in coral gables! Got takeout from here and the food was decent.  I=
 ordered a tonkatsu ramen, Singapore rice noodles, pineapple fried rice, ho=
ney roast pork, curry chicken rice, and chicken karaage.  Out of those, my =
favorites were the pineapple fried rice and Singapore rice noodles.  Prices=
 are reasonable and delivery was on time.  The food was delicious.  We orde=
r ramen, sweet and sour fried chicken, pad tai and tai donuts.  The portion=
s were pretty good and our kids loved sharing the dishes with us.  Love how=
 they bring out a pot of tea when we order tea.  Would definitely come back=
 when I'm craving some ramen! I was working in the Gables and decided to tr=
y this location.  I wouldn't say that the food blew me away but I was looki=
ng for a healthier option to fast food.  The restaurant itself is like a mo=
m and pop hole in the wall, its very clean and spacious but it has more of =
a casual atmosphere.  I ate a late dinner and popped in about 40 min before=
 closing, it was nice that I didn't feel rushed and the staff was welcoming=
  I was attended to right away and the food came out fast.  The portions w=
ere huge, it was tasty, but I do think that again, it was nothing that I wa=
s wowed by.  Overall, I would come back and try other options.  We always g=
et the Hell's ramen and a Pad Thai, never disappoints and they're quick.  T=
he Takoyaki appetizer is pretty good.  Tried this place out because it was =
the closet non-fastfood place to the Marriot I was staying at, at first gla=
nce I thought it was a Cuban restaurant from a distance and only realized w=
hat it was when I got closer.  The place is pretty small but the waitress w=
as quick to have me seated and hand me a menu, was torn between what I got =
and the ramen, but utimately decided to try something new.  During the enti=
re time I was browsing the menu the waitress continued to be a one man show=
, seating other customers and delivering food and drink all by self, all th=
e while making small talk with her guest, providing exceptional customer se=
rvice.  The food was out pretty fast and in a fairly large portion size too=
, it wasn't too spicy and was extremely tasty, now that I know this place i=
s nearby I'm going to come back again in the future to try their other menu=
 items.  This location does a lot of take out so there's never a wait to si=
t and the service is quick.  Wow, so good! Still thinking about our meal he=
re and it's been almost 2 weeks.  It was not full and we were a large party=
 of 6.  Service was great and the ladies were kind and prompt.  My favorite=
s were the Singapore noodles and the donburi bowl with beef.  The shrimp wi=
th spicy mayo was also delish! We shared the different plates and everyone =
left satisfied.  107 Taste in coral gables is a great addition to the area,=
 I've been to the Miami Lakes location many times but the size of Coral Gab=
les and how yummy rb food was makes me want to come back for more! I'm on a=
 quest for good broth with a depth of flavor and noodles right now! I actua=
lly enjoyed the food at the FIU location but shared my disappointment regar=
ding the overall cleanliness of that location. . . the Coral Gables locatio=
n was the exact opposite.  Clean from the door to the table.  I did not vis=
it the lavatory but I plan to return and check those important details soon=
! I remain a fan of the food.  Decided to order the exact same - Hell's Ram=
en and chicken karaage.  Actually a tad spicier than the FIU meal.  I'm a f=
an of spice so that works for me.  My date enjoyed his udon bowl and bao bu=
ns.  We both enjoyed a pot of hot green tea! One young man in the front of =
house.  He worked up to 4 tables and provided take out services to customer=
s.  He was overwhelmed from time to time but he managed.  It may be helpful=
 to have a little assistance when restaurant is busy.  I would have ordered=
 dessert but it felt like I was adding to the burdens of the lone waiter.  =
Definitely will return to this location in the near future.=20
