The airline industry has a rich history that traces back to the early 20th =

 successful flight in 1903 marked the commencement of the journey.  However=
, it wasn't until 1914 that the first scheduled passenger service took flig=

catalyzed the development of the modern airline industry, signaling the inc=
eption of commercial aviation.  In the initial stages, airplanes were used =
to carry mail across vast distances.  The U. S.  Post Office played a signi=
ficant role in developing the airline industry by awarding contracts to pri=
vate operators to deliver mail, leading to the establishment of several air=
lines.  These contract air mail (CAM) routes laid the foundation for a grow=

airliner.  This era saw faster, larger, and more efficient aircraft diminis=

the airline industry with the advent of wide-body aircraft like the Boeing =
747.  These jumbo jets could carry hundreds of passengers over longer dista=

 leveraged the low-cost model, focusing on shorter routes, minimal in-fligh=
