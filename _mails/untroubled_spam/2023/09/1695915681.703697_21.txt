Air traffic controllers have played a pivotal role in the safety and effici=
ency of air travel since the early days of aviation. . .=20

The profession traces its roots back to 1929 when Archie League, considered=
 the first air traffic controller, took his post at the St.  Louis Lambert =
International Airport. . . The history of air traffic controllers is a narr=
ative of evolution, an unfolding story marked by technological advancement,=
 increased air traffic, and the ever-present need for safety.  The role of =
these unsung heroes began in the early 20th century as the skies began to f=
ill with aircraft.  Initially, pilots relied on visual signals and basic gr=
ound-to-air communication, marking the primitive yet effective beginnings o=
f air traffic control.  In the 1930s, as the volume of flights increased, t=
he need for a more structured and organized system of air traffic control b=
ecame evident.  The first air traffic control towers were established, equi=
pped with radios to ensure efficient communication between the pilots and t=
he ground staff.  These early controllers were tasked with the coordination=
 of takeoffs, landings, and the general management of aircraft in the vicin=
ity of airports.  The introduction of radar technology in the 1940s marked =
a significant milestone in the evolution of air traffic control.  This tech=
nology enabled controllers to monitor aircraft with precision, ensuring saf=
e distances were maintained between planes.  The post-war boom in civil avi=
ation demanded enhanced safety protocols, leading to the establishment of c=
entralized air traffic control centers.  In 1958, the Federal Aviation Act =
was signed into law in the United States, establishing the Federal Aviation=
 Administration (FAA).  This organization was charged with overseeing and r=
egulating all aspects of civil aviation, including air traffic control.  Th=
