Had a nice lunch at the Bricktown Brewery, Brickwtown venue.  Went with an =
office group to celebrate a birthday.  Like the vibe of this location.  A m=
odern sports bar / brew pub in an old candy factory.  We started with the W=
atona cheese curds appitizer.  They were excellent.  Lightly battered and f=
ried.  Melt in your mouth delightful.  I give the cheese curds a 5/5.  I or=
dered the chickens nachos.  Wow, I couldn't believe the amount of nachos.  =
It's a huge serving.  It came loaded with chips, pulled chicken, black bean=
s, white queso, pepper Jack cheese blend, sour cream, guacamole, pico, coti=
ja cheese, and cilantro, salsa.  These nachos are robust and tasty.  It wil=
l definitely serve two for a meal and more as an appetizer.  I give the nac=
hos a 5/5.  The venue was quiet.  The service was very good.  The prices ar=
e moderate.  We were looking for a quick bite for dinner before bed and thi=
s place came with good recommendations.  The reason for the lack of 5 stars=
 is because we had to wait at the hostess stand for awhile before being ack=
nowledged.  Several people walked by without saying a word to us.  We ended=
 up sitting in the bar.  Found out it was open seating and could have passe=
d the hostess stand all together.  Waitress was pretty quick with beers to =
the table.  It didn't take long for us to order.  The place seemed pretty p=
oppin.  Not super busy but it was early.  I had the pepper honey chicken.  =
There was a bunch of chicken.  Two breasts.  Food was plentiful.  It was ta=
sty.  The honey made for a sticky mess but it was worth it.  I would recomm=
end some wet wipes after.  It would have helped the trip to the bathroom to=
 clean up.  Everyone that was with me had a good meal.  We all said that we=
 would stop in again.  Service was decent.  Nothing outside the ordinary bu=
t nothing amazing.  If you are in the area and want good food and good beer=
, feel free to stop in Looking for a place to eat after work, this place ca=
me up on my search.  Arriving alone, they told me to sit anywhere at the ba=
r area.  They had some people waiting for tables when I arrived.  Service a=
t the bar area was fast and staff was friendly.  I started with bluesberry =
beer.  They actually have blueberry in a glass.  Beer was just perfect for =
a hot day, refreshing.  For dinner I had bluesberry salmon.  I liked the na=
me of bluesberry, blues and blueberry togetherness.  Standard meal comes wi=
th mushed potatoes but I read in reviews that their sweet potato fries are =
really good, so I asked them to substitute.  I really liked the topping on =
the salmon.  Sweetness of apple and spiciness of jalapeo peppers perfectly =
matched together.  Sweet potato fries were very good as well.  Portion size=
 was big, I couldn't try their dessert but selection sounded nice.  Reasona=
ble price and friendly service.  Highly recommend We had a pleasant experie=
nce- I wish I could give 3. 5 stars.  Only reason for 3 stars is that our h=
atch chili burgers were sitting in liquid from the sauce - nobody should be=
 served a soggy bun! Other than that, everything was good.  Fish & chips we=
re delicious; fried chicken salad was equally delicious.  Salted Caramel Fr=
ies were worth the experiment.  We'd go back.  I don't understand any revie=
w under 5 stars! I'd give this place 10 if I could!! From the food, to serv=
ice, to management, everything is so incredible! We had Itzel as our waitre=
ss and Chris was the manager on staff.  I basically travel for a living and=
 this place made me feel cared about with good service and amazing food! (G=
et the sweet potato fries!) the restaurant had a good vibe! Could be a busi=
ness lunch or a cold beer with friends! We will definitely be back! Pure bl=
iss.  What can I say that isn't already known.  The food is amazing, and th=
e blueberry beer???? Yum! The beer isn't brewed by them anymore and is cont=
racted to another brewery.  I don't know what it used to taste like, but to=
 a new customer, it tastes incredible.  We continue to patronage this estab=
lishment every time we are in OKC.  This place was hoppin' when we stopped =
for a bite to eat today.  We elected to sit in the bar area since it was se=
at yourself there.  We had a (very friendly!) server.  They have a decent s=
election of beer and I opted for a sunrise margarita (big glass and only $8=
!).  We went with our server's suggestion of the buttermilk fried chicken s=
andwich.  We split it as it was huge! It came on a brioche bun, with grille=
d pineapple slices and honey to drizzle (or dip!).  We got the sweet potato=
 fries with sea salt and spice caramel sauce.  Wowie good! Very reasonable =
pricing for good food.  Make sure you stop here when you're in Bricktown! F=
ood was great! The waiter did a great job keeping our drinks topped off.  G=
reat ambiance all around.  Ordered chicken nachos to share and they were de=
licious.  We also ordered other entrees like the chicken fried chicken, bee=
f sandwich, salmon, and kids sliders.  Everything was delicious.  I think m=
y favorite one of all was the chicken nachos.=20
