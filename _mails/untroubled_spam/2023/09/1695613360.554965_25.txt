1.0"><!-- Lecturing at Leicester in June, I came for the first time ac=
ross a --><!-- falsehood of which I have since heard plenty. An irate =
Christian declared --><!-- that I was responsible for a book entitled =
the "Elements of Social --><!-- Science", which was, he averred, the "=
Bible of Secularists". I had never --><!-- heard of the book, but as h=
e insisted that it was in favor of the --><!-- abolition of marriage, =
and that Mr. Bradlaugh agreed with it, I promptly --><!-- contradicted=
 him, knowing that Mr. Bradlaugh's views on marriage were --><!-- cons=
ervative rather than revolutionary. On enquiry afterwards I found --><=
!-- that the book in question had been written some years before by a =
Doctor --><!-- of Medicine, and had been sent for review by its publis=
her to the --><!-- _National Reformer_ among other papers. I found fur=
ther that it consisted --><!-- of three parts; the first dealt with th=
e sexual relation, and advocated, --><!-- from the standpoint of an ex=
perienced medical man, what is roughly known --><!-- as "free love"; t=
he second was entirely medical, dealing with diseases; --><!-- the thi=
rd consisted of a very clear and able exposition of the law of --><!--=
 population as laid down by Malthus, and insisted--as John Stuart Mill=
 had --><!-- done--that it was the duty of married persons to voluntar=
ily limit their --><!-- families within their means of subsistence. Mr=
=2E Bradlaugh, in the --><!-- _National Reformer_, in reviewing the bo=
ok, stated that it was written --><!-- "with honest and pure intent an=
d purpose", and recommended to working men --><!-- the exposition of t=
he law of population. Because he did this Christians --><!-- and Torie=
s who desire to injure him still insist that he shares the --><!-- aut=
hor's views on sexual relations, and despite his reiterated --><!-- co=
ntradictions, they quote detached pieces of the work, speaking against=
 --><!-- marriage, as containing his views. Anything more meanly vile =
and --><!-- dishonest than this it would be difficult to imagine, yet =
such are the --><!-- weapons used against Atheists in a Christian coun=
try. Unable to find in --><!-- Mr. Bradlaugh's own writings anything t=
o serve their purpose, they take --><!-- isolated passages from a book=
 he neither wrote nor published, but once --><!-- reviewed with a reco=
mmendation of a part of it which says nothing against --><!-- marriage=
