I literally just went to sit at the bar to grab an appetizer.  I sat there,=
 sat there, sat there. . . .  While THREE employees stood there taking.  I =
was never helped.  I looked over at them a couple times - still no service.=
  So, I got up and left.  Oh, by the way, it was 3:45 in the afternoon and =
no one else was at the bar.  Why they couldn't be bothered to help me, I'll=
 never know.  Ohmygosh! Why have I never been here before?!?!? The food was=
 so delicious, the wine perfect, and the service delightful.  Every employe=
e was very kind and helpful.  The industrial feel was not at all cold or of=
f putting.  Finished off with the whiskey cake.  Again! Ohmygosh! Why have =
I never been here before?!?!? Will definitely be back soon! Busy travel day=
, started in Baton Rouge, stop in Dallas and ended the day in OKC! Road tro=
dden i dropped in at whiskey cake I'm a fan of this restaurant, ambiance is=
 rustic deco with open industrial ceiling and finishes.  Not messing around=
 i ordered fried green tomatos and the grilled salmon entree.  Both execute=
d perfectly, salmon had excellent flavor and came with shredded brussel spr=
out salad with craisans and carrots Happy to get in before they closed for =
the night another good meal at Whiskey Cake Initially I held low expectatio=
ns for Whiskey Cake, however much to my consternation (except for the Lemon=
grass Shrimp dish), everything was really enjoyable.  They offer a brunch, =
lunch/dinner, and social hour menu equipped with an all-day whiskey list.  =
We came for lunch and were helped out by the endearing TeeJay! The menu con=
sisted of dishes like Roasted Butternut Squash-Creamed Farro, Steak Frites,=
 Cauliflower-Parsnip Mash, Bone-In Pork Chop, and Smoked Gouda and Duroc Ha=
m Mac & Cheese.  We got: Endless Summer ($13): Old Forester Bourbon, Cointr=
eau, strawberry-rhubarb simple, cucumber, lemon.  Bohemian Raspberry ($14):=
 Buffalo Trace Bourbon, raspberry simple, lime, mint, ginger beer.  Hand Cu=
t Fries with Mustard Seed Ketchup ($6): sadly underwhelming, but the mustar=
d seeds in the ketchup were nice.  Flash-Fried Brussel Sprouts ($9): roaste=
d sunflower seeds, honey-lemon pepper glaze, bbq-lime aioli, shaved ricotta=
 salata.  This was extremely well-prepared and could easily be a repeat ord=
er for me.  Whiskey Braised Beef ($28): roasted cauliflower-parsnip mash, b=
raising sauce, hemp seed gremolata, crisp root vegetable "hay".  Very well-=
cooked.  Shrimp and Grits ($26): white cheddar-roasted green chile grits, w=
ilted greens, garlic herb-cream, smoked bacon, blistered baby heirloom toma=
toes, micro basil.  This was my first time having grits and it was really e=
njoyable.  So yummy.  Lemongrass Shrimp and Noodle $16: wild arugula, shave=
d cabbage, snap peas, hand-shucked corn, vine ripe tomatoes, radish, Thai b=
asil ginger dressing.  Meh. .  overwhelmingly dull dish (and yeah I don't k=
now why you'd get this kind of entre here either :D) Not authentic in any w=
ay.  Visited Whiskey Cake for our first time with some friends! Definitely =
a fun, busy, trendy environment.  Our server Mallorie was super sweet and h=
elpful.  My husband got their eggs benedict with pulled pork, while I order=
ed the birria smash burger.  The eggs benedict was yummy and came with a sm=
all dish of fresh fruit.  I thought it was really flavorful and tasty! Both=
 my husband and I were not fans of the consume dipping sauce that came with=
 the birria burger, and the burger itself was good (kind of was more like a=
 sandwich with the baguette and thin patty) but not outstanding.  We also t=
ried our friend's cinnamon roll, and that was delicious!! Expect to spend a=
t least $15-25 per person, and the portion sizes are okay but not huge.  Th=
e atmosphere is a little noisy indoors, so it made it hard to hear conversa=
tion.  This was SO good! We are now Whiskey Cake stans because of our exper=
ience here.  Parking was easy, they have their own lot.  We should have got=
 a reservation ahead of time, as there was a little bit of a wait.  They ha=
ve nice couches to lounge on while you wait.  It was about 20 minutes befor=
e we were seated in a nice corner booth.  Our waitress Malia was incredible=
 and so good to us.  My husband was able to try some whiskey before orderin=
g some, and he appreciated the kind and patient gentleman who helped out.  =
We were celebrating my husband's recent promotion, so we enjoyed an appetiz=
er, our entrees, and dessert.  We ordered the roasted garlic hummus as our =
starter.  It was really flavorful! The pita bread was great and so was thei=
r fresh veggies.  I ordered the double burger and fries, and their fries ar=
e almost like beer battered, with a little bit of cinnamon taste.  Burger w=
as huge.  Husband got the pork ribs and LOVED it.  Mac and cheese wasn't ve=
ry flavorful, just white cheddar tasting.  The showstopper of the night was=
 the delicious whiskey cake.  Wow oh wow.  I've raved about Bar Cicchetti's=
 cookie Sunday and this whiskey cake has very similar flavors just in a com=
pletely different vessel - cake.  How heavenly.  I cannot wait to be back a=
nd bring everyone I know! This place is beyond amazing and their menu isn't=
 just your run of the mill burger and chicken strips, they have amazing fri=
ed green tomatoes and this is one time you have to Save room for dessert, o=
r you will be sorry that you missed the Whiskey Cake!! What an AMAZING farm=
 to table restaurant! DJ our server was super helpful with suggestions.  Th=
e service was top notch as well as the food! The wings had great flavor and=
 I would order those again with a salad.  The Steak frites was yummy and th=
e steak was cooked to perfection and full of flavor.  The chicken melt sand=
wich was huge! We also got a side of Mac n cheese.  Talk about a warm hug! =
Can't say enough wonder things about this place.  A must restaurant if you =
are in town.=20
