39 Restaurant is located in the First American Museum and should not be mis=
sed! The restaurant is surrounded by glass and is bright.  Our server, Dani=
, greeted us with a smile.  Hubby and I both ordered the bison burger, and =
Hubby upgraded to truffle fries.  OH MY, perhaps one of the best bison burg=
ers I have ever had.  The arugula added a yummy pepper taste to the burger =
and was a perfect companion.  Hubby added the commodity (commod) cheese to =
his burger, which is the "government cheese" like velveeta. . .  Hubby said=
 the cheese was tasty.  The thick wedges of fries are crispy on the outside=
 and tender on the inside.  If you a huge fan of truffles, then upgrade the=
 fries.  Otherwise, the plain fries are crispy and fantastic.  Prices were =
reasonable.  39 Restaurant is worth a stop even if you are not visiting the=

siting the museum.  We came for a Valentine's dinner, so our experience was=
 a bit different than a normal night, although I am sure both are great.  F=
irstly, it was a very last minute reservation, which I am very gracious the=
y could accommodate due to their also receiving a last minute cancellation =
from another guest.  We were promptly seated and greeted with an adjusted m=
enu for the evening with some very tasty choices to make.  We each tried se=
parate 1st and 3rd courses, though we both had the same main entree, which =
was a Bison dish.  The Bison dish was very well prepared and the Crawfish B=
isque was fantastic! They absolutely nailed the dinner menu, and the desser=
ts were great to finish it off.  The waitress we had seemed new, she didn't=
 pour our water, didn't get my drink order right, and stuck her thumb in my=
 bisque. . .  but she was friendly and seemed to be trying hard all the sam=
e so I cannot complain at all.  If there is any room for improvement, it wo=
uld be with the $49. 99 wine pairing.  This was for 1 person, and came with=
 1 glass of sauvignon blanc, 1 glass of pinot, and a mini espresso martini.=
  While they were paired well, ordering these separately would have been ar=
ound half the price depending on what they value their martini at, so I thi=
nk someone really needs to check their math or maybe offer a more premium s=
election for the up charge.  Overall it was a great night and we will be ba=
ck to try their normal menu soon!
