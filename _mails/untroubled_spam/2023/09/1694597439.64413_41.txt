So I was there last night for a Birthday dinner.  The atmosphere is nice an=
d I absolutely love the kitchens open concept.  For appetizers we enjoyed t=
he salmon crispy rice and yellow fin tartare.  We shared a delicious steak,=
 Brussel sprouts, mash potatoes, and onion rings.  BUT, what was NOT so gre=
at was that our waiter forgot to put all of our sides in our to-go bag.  We=
 left headed back home to Edmond and we were in disbelief.  And YES it was =
clear to him to bag everything to include the bread that we didn't finish. =
 I honestly believe he must've took them out when adding our to-go chocolat=
e cake in the bag.  And to be honest, I didn't check the bag because certai=
n places just have levels for attention to detail, so if I'm eating in a ni=
ce atmosphere, I don't feel the need to check my food as if I was at a driv=
e through.  I want my sides damn it.  Now I have this steak from last night=
 and no sides.  I would've tipped only 10% versus 20% It's been 8 months si=
nce I last had Stock and Bond and I felt a little disappointed when I came =
back recently.  The service was the same, which is great! Our server (name =
on receipt said Goose) was friendly and attentive.  He constantly made sure=
 we had a clean table and gave us his recommendations.  My wife and I order=
ed the exact same meal as last time, 8oz filet and 16oz Delmonico steak wit=
h mushrooms and root vegetable gratin side dishes.  I have no idea what hap=
pened but nothing looked and tasted like it did last time.  Our steaks had =
no sear and almost looked. . . wet? Flavor was somewhat there but the textu=
re was completely off.  The root vegetable gratin was still pretty great, a=
 little more cheesy than I remembered but I enjoyed it! I loved the mushroo=
m side dish last time because it was a medley of different mushrooms with d=
ifferent textures and taste.  The mushroom side dish changed completely and=
 was only mushroom caps.  The redeemer of the evening was the cinnamon brea=
d pudding.  Loved the sweetness and the bread reminded me of the bread they=
 bring to you at the beginning of your meal.  I'm hoping this was a one-off=
 experience for us.  INCREDIBLE! This is definitely up there on my favorite=
 places to grab a steak in OKC! It was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing!=
 We got several appetizers and sides because everything sounded so good, bu=
t it tasted even better.  My favorite appetizer was probably the salmon cri=
spy rice.  The texture was unlike anything I've ever had before.  Their rol=
ls tasted like clouds of butter and happiness.  The bread pudding is made w=
ith these rolls and is just perfection.  Our waiter was so attentive and al=
ways willing to give his opinion, like getting a garlic crust with crab osc=
ar on top! We will definitely be going back! We tried this place out last m=
onth for a date night for a change from our usual steakhouse we visit in ok=
c.  Love it's location downtown in the beautiful national building! They st=
art you out with delicious rolls that were always fresh and warm but were a=
 tad on the salty side for my liking.  The cocktails were fabulous! I think=
 the name of mine was rum boxcar or something it was delicious! Our steaks =
were okay we prefer another steakhouse more on the steak but it was delicio=
us and we finished it without any problem.  Their fried onion rings were de=
licious!! Perfectly crispy and serving size was massive! I did not like the=
 max and cheese one bit.  It was homemade in house they said and just diffe=
rent style cheese than what i like.  Service was good we never felt rushed =
like some steakhouses do as they just want to turn tables you feel like.  W=
ow, wow, wow! Now this is a steakhouse experience that I will never forget!=
 From the moment I stepped through the doors I knew we were in for an amazi=
ng night.  Located in the lovely First National Bank, Stock & Bond spared n=
o expense to truly elevate their space.  With a modernized western vibe, th=
ey pay homage to local cattle farmers while making sure to keep the space f=
eeling elegant and upscale.  We sat near the open concept kitchen, and it w=
as so cool to watch the chefs at work.  And if you're a whiskey or bourbon =
lover, you came to the right place.  Their whiskey list is so long, that it=
 comes in a leather bounded book.  Not a pamphlet, a BOOK.  Safe to say you=
 will find the drink you're looking for! Also, if you can get a chance, be =
sure to check our their Whiskey Room.  It's STUNNING!
