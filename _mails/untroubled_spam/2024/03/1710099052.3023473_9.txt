<p><b style=3D"font: 7px Microsoft Sans Serif; color: #87AFC7;"> They decid=
ed to plant an orchard of cotton candy. He dreamed of eating green apples w=
ith worms. He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby. S=
he learned that water bottles are no longer just to hold liquid, but they&#=
39;re also status symbols. At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music,=
 he was living an experience.   Flesh-colored yoga pants were far worse tha=
n even he feared. He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in his neigh=
bor&#39;s yard. The fish listened intently to what the frogs had to say. A =
quiet house is nice until you are ordered to stay in it for months. The mys=
terious diary records the voice. Jeanne wished she has chosen the red butto=
n. He strives to keep the best lawn in the neighborhood. There were three s=
phered rocks congregating in a cubed room. The opportunity of a lifetime pa=
ssed before him as he tried to decide between a cone or a cup. A dead duck =
doesn&#39;t fly backward. The spa attendant applied the deep cleaning mask =
to the gentleman&rsquo;s back. The llama couldn&#39;t resist trying the lem=
onade. Whenever he saw a red flag warning at the beach he grabbed his surfb=
oard. The glacier came alive as the climbers hiked closer. Everyone pretend=
s to like wheat until you mention barley. I covered my friend in baby oil. =
Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone. Truth in advertising and d=
inosaurs with skateboards have much in common. She saw the brake lights, bu=
t not in time. Cursive writing is the best way to build a race track.     A=
lways bring cinnamon buns on a deep-sea diving expedition. She was only mad=
e the society president because she can whistle with her toes. He liked to =
play with words in the bathtub. As the asteroid hurtled toward earth, Becky=
 was upset her dentist appointment had been canceled. The elephant didn&#39=
;t want to talk about the person in the room. As he looked out the window, =
he saw a clown walk by. She was the type of girl that always burnt sugar to=
 show she cared.  He figured a few sticks of dynamite were easier than a fi=
shing pole to catch fish.  If my calculator had a history, it would be more=
 embarrassing than my browser history. Iguanas were falling out of the tree=
s. I used to practice weaving with spaghetti three hours a day but stopped =
because I didn&#39;t want to die alone. As he looked out the window, he saw=
 a clown walk by. We have never been to Asia, nor have we visited Africa. I=
t doesn&#39;t sound like that will ever be on my travel list. Beach-combing=
 replaced wine tasting as his new obsession. He wasn&#39;t bitter that she =
had moved on but from the radish.</b></p>=0D
