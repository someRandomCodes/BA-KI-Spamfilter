<p><b style="font: 7.5px Simplified Chinese; color: #646D7E;">I&rsquo;m a living furnace.That must be the tenth time I&#39;ve been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars.The mysterious diary records the voice.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.Barking dogs and screaming toddlers have the unique ability to turn friendly neighbors into cranky enemies.I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.Lucifer was surprised at the amount of at Death Valley.He quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started.The trick to getting kids to eat anything is to put catchup on it.Mary plays the piano.Too many prisons have become early coffins.I am nevr at hom on Sundays.When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a phobia of heights.They were excited to see their first sloth.He was the of the club who didn&#39;t like plum pudding.They&#39;re playing the piano while flying in the plane.At that moment I was the most fearsome weasel in the entire swamp.I received a heavy fine but it failed to crush my spirit.I thought red would have felt warmer in summer but I didn&#39;t think about the equator.Having no hair made him look even hairier.The bug was having an excellent day until he hit the windshield.She had convinced her kids that any mushroom found on the ground would kill them if they touched it.The irony of the situation wasn&#39;t lost on anyone in the room.He was sitting in a trash can with high street class.Tuesdays are fre if you bring a gnome costume.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.There&#39;s an art to getting your way, and spitting olive pits across the table isn&#39;t it.The beauty of the sunset was obscured by the industrial cranes.</b></p>
