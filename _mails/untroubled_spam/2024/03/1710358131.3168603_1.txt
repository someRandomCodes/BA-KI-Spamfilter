<span style=3D"color:#FFFFFF;font-size:7px;">In the 1920s, Messager kept pa=
ce with the change in fashion in musical theatre, consciously absorbing the=
 styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a =
Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences. He collab=
orated with Sacha Guitry on the musical comedies L&#39;Amour masqu&eacute; =
(1923) and Deburau (1926), starring Yvonne Printemps. The former was a cons=
iderable success in Paris, but in London the official censor, the Lord Cham=
berlain, declared it &quot;unfit for the English public&quot;, and banned C=
 B. Cochran&#39;s planned production starring Printemps and Guitry. In Mes=
sager&#39;s late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of th=
e nineteenth century, with hints of Faur&eacute; and, particularly, Chabrie=
r&#39;s L&#39;&Eacute;toile. Faur&eacute;, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go=
 to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of L&#39;Amour masqu&eacute; =
and wrote to Messager, &quot;Your wit is the same as always &ndash; it neve=
r grows old &ndash; and so are your charm and very personal brand of music =
that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning&quot;. Faur&e=
acute; died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of Deburau=
 to his memory. In 1924 Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Messager to conduct the =
Paris premieres of Auric&#39;s ballet Les F&acirc;cheux and Poulenc&#39;s L=
es Biches. In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important upd=
ates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sue=
d the BBC for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his co=
nsent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to Geo=
rge Edwardes, whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. =
