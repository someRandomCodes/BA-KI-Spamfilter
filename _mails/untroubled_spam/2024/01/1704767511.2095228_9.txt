			At first, I was very much like you. I was skeptical. I did not believe that this &quot;Magical&quot; towel was any different from other towels sold at a local store.<br />
			<br />
			In fact, this very same towel was introduced to me several months ago. I&#39;ve put it aside until recently, where I&#39;ve started to test it. I was blown away on the performance of this advanced technology!<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			<i style="font-family:rockwell; color:#008000;">This is NOT just a regular towel or even a micro fiber towel that many are raving about. This is a revolutionary piece of fabric that contains Nanolon Fiber technology and it is 100 times thinner than one human hair!</i><br />
			<br />
			All you need is this Nanolon Fiber Towel and Water to clean virtually anything - even the permanent marker on your mirror!<br />
