Remember the movie My Left Foot?

It was an Oscar winning film with Daniel Day Lewis about 30 years ago.

Inside the movie he played a severely disabled boy.

…Only able to move his left foot.

Daniel had some severe behavioral problems.

He was a real handful and really frustrated.

Until that is…

One day-quite by accident- his family realized he was…

A GENIUS!

http://www.turntextspeech.sa.com/34173-1994-3775-589167226/bruce/tindex11.html

…And able to create amazing world class art work.

After that realization- everything changed.

The intelligence and gifts he had were unlocked.

His frustration and behavior problems stopped and there was an incredible Hollywood ending (a fairytale ending)

Here’s the point…

Inside your dog-there is incredible intelligence too.

I’ve seen it in hundreds of Dogs I’ve worked with.

And once you unlock that intelligence.

Most behavioral problems simply melt away.

And the bond with you and your dog grows stronger.

Sound good?
