<p><b style=3D"font: 7px Palatino Linotype; color: #736F6E;">The group quic=
kly understood that toxic waste was the most effective barrier to use again=
st the zombies.  If you like tuna and tomato sauce, try combining the two, =
it&rsquo;s really not as bad as it sounds. One small action would change he=
r life, but whether it would be for better or for worse was yet to be deter=
mined. Seek success, but always be prepared for random cats. The bug was ha=
ving an excellent day until he hit the windshield. I would have gotten the =
promotion, but my attendance wasn&rsquo;t good enough. That must be the ten=
th time I&#39;ve been arrested for selling deep-fried cigars. He always wor=
e his sunglasses at night. He picked up trash in his spare time to dump in =
his neighbor&#39;s yard. She saw the brake lights, but not in time. When co=
nfronted with a rotary dial phone the teenager was perplexed.  She can live=
 her life however she wants as long as she listens to what I have to say. S=
he couldn&#39;t understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full o=
f cotton candy.  The opportunity of a lifetime passed before him as he trie=
d to decide between a cone or a cup. She could hear him in the shower singi=
ng with a joy she hoped he&#39;d retain after she delivered the news. Writi=
ng a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would b=
e. The llama couldn&#39;t resist trying the lemonade. Today we gathered mos=
s for my uncle&#39;s wedding. Excitement replaced fear until the final mome=
nt.  This made him feel like an old-style rootbeer float smells.  Truth in =
advertising and dinosaurs with skateboards have much in common. She saw the=
 brake lights, but not in time.  The hawk didn&rsquo;t understand why the g=
round squirrels didn&rsquo;t want to be his friend. The fence was confused =
about whether it was supposed to keep things in or keep things out. Iron py=
rite is the most foolish of all minerals. It didn&#39;t make sense unless y=
ou had the power to eat colors. When money was tight, he&#39;d get his lunc=
h money from the local wishing well. If I don&rsquo;t like something, I&rsq=
uo;ll stay away from it. Nobody questions who built the pyramids in Mexico.=
 Mothers spend months of their lives waiting on their children. He turned i=
n the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would have not passed the cla=
ss. Red is greener than purple, for sure. The old rusted farm equipment sur=
rounded the house predicting its demise. It took him a month to finish the =
meal. She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things all the wo=
rse. The tortoise jumped into the lake with dreams of becoming a sea turtle=
 If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my bro=
wser history. Little Red Riding Hood decided to wear orange today. All you =
need to do is pick up the pen and begin. Even with the snow falling outside=
, she felt it appropriate to wear her bikini. The father handed each child =
a roadmap at the beginning of the 2-day road trip and explained it was so t=
hey could find their way home. They did nothing as the raccoon attacked the=
 lady&rsquo;s bag of food.  He looked behind the door and didn&#39;t like w=
hat he saw.</b></p>=0D
