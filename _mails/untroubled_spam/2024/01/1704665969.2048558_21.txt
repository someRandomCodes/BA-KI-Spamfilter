Dear Friend</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
It is with trust and confidence that i write to make this urgent business proposal to you. I was assigned by two of my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for the transfer of us$52,750,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$52.750 million, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$52,750,000.00 million)15% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account&nbsp; while 85% will be reserved for us.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before&nbsp; you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us including your bank name &amp; address, account number,telephone number.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Note: our president Muhammadu Buhari collaborated with Ibrahim Magu as the new EFCC chairman, Economic Financial Crime Commission, Mr.Ibrahim Magu&nbsp; to stop the junior ranks officers from transferring funds out&nbsp; of the country. He sent different Cublication to many countries in the world as propaganda to discourage all government Officials from transferring funds into an overseas account to avoid and save guides the countries economy.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Apparently, so that other government officials will not benefits from these( oil windfalls venture) where he has been a culprit alone with his aides. More details about this transaction will be given to you as soon as we receive your positive respond.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated. In addition, there are some faceless beings in my country that are making use of top government official names to swindle money from innocent citizens and that includes my name. You can confirm by searching the name of our Central Bank of Nigeria Governor; you will see that his name is part of the scam list meanwhile we are innocent officials completely unaware of the situation happening. </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Yours faithfully,</DIV>
<DIV>
