It didn&rsquo;t and they don&rsquo;t recommend anyone else do it either.In the end, he realized he could see sound and hear words.He understood why what, when, and where left out who.Even though he thought the world was flat he didn&rsquo;t see the irony of wanting to travel around the world.Nobody loves a pig wearing lipstick.Cursive writing is thebest way to build a race track.Iguanas were falling out of the trees.</b></p>
