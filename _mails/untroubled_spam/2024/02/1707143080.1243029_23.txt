<p><b style="font: 6px Sitka; color: #646D7E;">As you consider the possible ways to improve yourself and the world, you notice John Travolta seems fairly unhappy.Toddlers feeding raccoons surprised even the seasoned park ranger.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.The complicated school homework left the parents trying to help their kids quite confused.I&rsquo;m working on a sweet potato farm.Dolores wouldn&#39;t have eaten the meal if she had known what it actually was.As the years pass by, we know owners look more and more like their dogs.She was disgusted he couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between lemonade and limeade.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his .When I cook spaghetti, I like to boil it a few minutes past al dente so the noodles are super slippery.There were white out conditions in the town; subsequently, the roads were impassable.Standing on one&#39;s head at job interviews forms a lasting impression.Her scream silenced the rowdy teenagers.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.Jerry liked to look at paintings while eating garlic ice cream.She was too short to see over the fence.Some bathing suits just shouldn&rsquo;t be worn by some people.The bees decided to have a mutiny against their queen.He was so preoccupied with whether or not he could that he failed to to consider if he should.My secretary is the person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.You have every right to be angry, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to be mean.The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.The waitress was not amused when he ordered green eggs and ham.Potato wedges probably are not best for relationships.Don&#39;t piss in my garden and tell me you&#39;re trying to help my plants grow.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.Abstraction is often one floor above you.Facing his greatest fear, he ate his first marshmallow.If my calculator had a history, it would be more embarrassing than my browser history.She used her own hair in the soup to give it more flavor.</b></p>
