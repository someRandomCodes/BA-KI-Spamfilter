Hi,

No one sees your hot flashes or your night sweats...

No one sees your fatigue or your restless nights...

But hiding that dreaded "meno-belly" can feel next to impossible, right?

It's like it comes and goes with the tides...

The water retention... the gas... the bloating...

Nothing fits right, it's uncomfortable as all get-out...

I know – I hated it too.

But I'm about to share a solution with you that can flatten your belly starting in a matter of days...

Without restrictive dieting... without an obnoxious exercise routine... and without changing anything more than the first 20 seconds of your morning.

It's confirmed by Yale research... it works fast... it's completely natural...

And it's about to throw the $40 million HRT industry right on its ear!

Because it gets to the root cause of all that bloat... and, believe it or not, it has NOTHING to do with your estrogen or progesterone levels.

Want to see if it'll work for you?

w and ice exceeds ablation. A glacier usually originates from a cirque landform (alternatively known as a corrie or as a cwm) – a typically armchair-shaped geological feature (such as a depression between mountains enclosed by arêtes) – which collects and compresses through gravity the snow that falls into it. This snow accumulates and the weight of the snow falling above compacts it, forming névé (granular snow). Further crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns it into "glacial ice". This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it "overflows" through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as a gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice reaches sufficient thickness, it begins to move by a combination of surface slope, gravity, and pressure. On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15 m (49 ft) of snow-ice. In temperate glaciers, snow repeatedly freezes and thaws, changing into granular ice called firn. Under the pressure of the layers of ice and snow above it, this granular ice fuses into denser firn. Over a period of years, layers of firn undergo further compaction and become glacial ice.[21] Glacier ice is slightly more dense than ice formed from frozen water because glacier ice contains fewer trapped air bubbles. Glacial ice has a distinctive blue tint because it absorbs some red light due to an overtone of the infrared OH stretching mode of the water molecule. (Liquid water appears blue for the same reason. The blue of glacier ice is sometimes misattributed to Rayleigh scattering of bubbles in the ice.)[22] Structure Black ice glacier near Aconcagua, Argentina A glacier originates at a location called its glacier head and terminates at its glacier foot, snout, or terminus.
