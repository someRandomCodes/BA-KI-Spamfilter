"It was super fun to use. We were gone for four nights, and didn't have to get ice at all. Not having to deal with ice the whole time was amazing. I was worried that it wasn't big enough. But it held absolutely everything I was planning to take because I didn't have to put any ice in there. It didn't have to be as big as my regular cooler."

Randy M. 5 Stars
"You cannot beat it. It is awesome. No running around, looking for drinks. No more opening up your drink and setting it on the tractor and coming back 20 minutes later and it's warm. Everything's cold. Everything's cold all the time. Just a wonderful, wonderful unit. I am a Type 1 diabetic. It's been keeping my insulin cold to the point where I don't worry about my insulin. I know it's good."

Damon H. 5 Stars
"We all have lots of coolers. But this is a cooler extraordinaire. Not only is it a cooler, it's a fully-functioning refrigerator. It's great for me being a fisherman and an outdoor guy. I can put a bunch of fish in here and set it at freezing temperatures. And when I get home, my fish will stay frozen and I don't need any ice. It's a great tool. It's absolutely a must for campers and fisherman. It looks like a cooler, but it's actually a refrigerator which makes it a really special thing."

Lisa W. 5 Stars
"You don't have to stop and get ice anymore. That was one thing I hated to do early in the morning when we had to leave to go out of town to play in a baseball tournament. We had to leave at 5 or 6 or sometimes 4:30 in the morning and had to stop to get ice for our cooler. So this is nice because you just have to set it on refrigerator mode and you get your cold drinks or whatever you put in your cooler. People are already taking pictures with it, trying to find out more information so they could get their own."

Lou H. 5 Stars
"Please get one or two of them like I did. They will come in handy next time you have a power failure or going on a trip. I use mine whenever we travel or recently when we had a power failure a few weeks ago. You won't be sorry."

ore the advent of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers and hunted animals for food.[10] Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing is thought to be the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed.[11] While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC.[12] Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.[13] Throughout recorded history, the rich have been able to afford a varied diet including meat, vegetables and fruit, but for poor people, meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull, typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice, rye, barley, wheat, millet or maize. The addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to the diet. The staple diet of the Aztecs in Central America was maize and they cultivated tomatoes, avocados, beans, peppers, pumpkins, squashes, peanuts, and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge. In Peru, the Incas subsisted on maize in the lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes. They al

        "We all have lots of coolers. But this is a cooler extraordinaire. Not only is it a cooler, it's a fully-functioning refrigerator. It's great for me being a fisherman and an outdoor guy. I can put a bunch of fish in here and set it at freezing temperatures. And when I get home, my fish will stay frozen and I don't need any ice. It's a great tool. It's absolutely a must for campers and fisherman. It looks like a cooler, but it's actually a refrigerator which makes it a really special thing."</p>

        "You don't have to stop and get ice anymore. That was one thing I hated to do early in the morning when we had to leave to go out of town to play in a baseball tournament. We had to leave at 5 or 6 or sometimes 4:30 in the morning and had to stop to get ice for our cooler. So this is nice because you just have to set it on refrigerator mode and you get your cold drinks or whatever you put in your cooler. People are already taking pictures with it, trying to find out more information so they could get their own."</p>

They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers and hunted animals for food.[10] Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing is thought to be the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed.[11] While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC.[12] Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.[13]

Throughout recorded history, the rich have been able to afford a varied diet including meat, vegetables and fruit, but for poor people, meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull, typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice, rye, barley, wheat, millet or maize. The addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to the diet. The staple diet of the Aztecs in Central America was maize and they cultivated tomatoes, avocados, beans, peppers, pumpkins, squashes, peanuts, and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge. In Peru, the Incas subsisted on maize in the lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes. They al</p>
