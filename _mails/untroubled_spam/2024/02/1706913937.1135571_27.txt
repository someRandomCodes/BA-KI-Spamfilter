Taking B12 for nerve pain? (important warning)

B12 has been touted as an effective way to support nerve health and even reduce discomfort, but seasoned expert, Dr. Don Kennedy sheds some shocking light on the true facts.

Dr. Kennedy warns that most B12 supplements found in stores contain “cyanocobalamin,” which is essentially an artificial form of B12.

The good news? There is a “Game-Changing” B12 solution that he recommends to all of his patients, but can’t be found in stores.

Last we checked, Dr. Kennedy was giving away free starter bottles of his go to solution for those that qualify. Quantities are limited.

esser collection was transferred to the Victoria University of Manchester, but the skin was apparently not part of this transfer. Joseph Grinnell, who attempted to locate the holotype in 1931, suggested that Dresser may have been unaware of the specimen's significance and may have given it elsewhere.[3]: 271–272  The snowy plover is one of the best-studied endemic shorebirds of the Americas, although most of this research was carried out on western North American populations, with few monitoring programs targeting the South American and eastern North American populations.[4] Plovers (Charadriinae) are a subfamily of small shorebirds that breed in open habitats on all continents except Antarctica.[5] Together with the lapwings (Vanellinae), they form the family Charadriidae. The snowy plover was traditionally considered to be a species within the genus Charadrius, which comprised 32 extant species and was therefore the most species-rich genus of the family.[6] However, a 2013 genetic analysis found that the lapwings are nested within Charadrius; the latter is therefore polyphyletic (is not a natural group, i.e., the most distantly related Charadrius species are more closely related to lapwings than to each other).[7][8] Some subsequent studies confirmed this and proposed to split Charadrius into five separate genera. The snowy plover, formerly Charadrius nivosus, was transferred into the genus Anarhynchus, as Anarhynchus nivosus, along with 22 other plover species; in 2023, this transfer was recognized by the International Ornithologi
