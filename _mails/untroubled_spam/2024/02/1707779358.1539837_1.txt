Dear Friend


My apology for sending this unsolicited mail to you; I actually got your e-=
mail contact through my online exploration for proficient business persons =
and l decided to contact you directly about this business venture. I was as=
signed by my colleague to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in =
providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for th=
e transfer of us$75,500,000.00 pending on our arrival in your country for u=
tilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.

This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract =
awarded by our ministry, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (F.M.A)to an e=
xpatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the or=
iginal contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$75,500,000.00 m=
illion, which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour f=
or disbursement among ourselves. The transfer of this money can only be pos=
sible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary=
 of the fund.

As government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, an=
d this is the reason why we decided to contact you. We have agreed that if =
you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$75,500,000.00 =
million)18% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account whil=
e 2% will be set aside for the expenses incurred during the cost of transfe=
r of the fund into your account while 80% will be reserved for us.

We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account num=
ber in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred. We in=
tend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own=
 share of the money.

Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements toward=
s the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before you. F=
or security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that=
 you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.

We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray=
 us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. =
Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal i=
s acceptable to you,indicate your interest by sending a email to us includi=
ng your bank name & address, account number,telephone number.

Note that the particular nature of your company's business is irrelevant to=
 this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response =
will be appreciated.

Yours faithfully,



Mr.George Emeka Emerah
Director, Finance Mini of Agriculture.
