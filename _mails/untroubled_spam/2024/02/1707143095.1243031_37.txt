<p><b style="font: 4px Abadi MT Condensed Light; color: #6960EC;">As you consider the possible ways to improve yourself and the world, you notice John Travolta seems fairly unhappy.He found rain fascinating yet unpleasant.David subscribes to the &quot;stuff your tent into the bag&quot; strategy over nicely folding it.Everyone pretends to like wheat until you mention barley.While on the first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam.I think I will the red car, or I will lease the blue one.Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone.Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.The tattered work gloves speak of the many hours of hard labor he endured throughout his .Two seats were vacant.The lyrics of the song sounded like fingernails on a chalkboard.She wrote him a long letter, but he didn&#39;t read it.They finished building the road they knew no one would ever use.Car safety systems have come a long way, but he was out to prove they could be outsmarted.She hadn&#39;t had her cup of coffee, and that made things the worse.The shooter says goodbye to his love.Their argument could be heard across the parking lot.The toy brought back fond memories of being lost in the rain forest.Grape jelly was leaking out the hole in the roof.My secretary is the person who truly understands my stamp-collecting obsession.The fact that there&#39;s a stairway to heaven and a highway to hell explains well.It was the first time he had ever seen someone cook dinner on an elephant.The waitress was not amused when he ordered green eggs and ham.My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she likes the same things that I do.Don&#39;t piss in my garden and tell me you&#39;re trying to help my plants grow.The underground bunker was filled with chips and candy.At that moment he wasn&#39;t listening to music, he was living an experience.The old rusted farm equipment surrounded the house predicting its demise.They improved dramatically once the lead singer left.She is happy until she finds something to be unhappy about; then, she is overjoyed.</b></p>
