 =09=09Hi Customer Service Team,

I'm contacting you regarding a=
 problem with a charge from my bank
account that appears to have been mad=
e through your online platform.

I was dismayed to notice this withdraw=
al, as I have never visited your
site before. Moreover, I have all the ne=
cessary proof demonstrating
that I did not authorize this transaction. Th=
is includes payment
records which I have already submitted to my bank as =
part of my claim.

I would appreciate if you could provide me with any =
available details
regarding this withdrawal, such as the invoice number, =
and any other
relevant information to assist in resolving this matter.
=

Thank you for your help in this matter. I'm looking forward to your
ti=
mely response.

Yours faithfully,

Harri Chase
